cHAIRMAN's sTATEMENT
sTRATEgY
 e last year has seen Luminar consolidate its position as the leader within
the late night entertainment market and sharpen its focus on operating its
high quality estate of Oceana, Liquid and Lava & Ignite brands. Eight new
branded units were opened during the year.
Significant progress has been made towards achieving our strategy of
creating an optimal business of 110 high quality venues during FY2011.
 e Board is focused on delivering its clear plan and strives to consistently
achieve high returns for shareholders.
Luminar remains extremely cash generative and is in the second year of a
three year programme of enhancing shareholder returns.
 e Group's strategy is clearly focused around three key streams to create
enhanced shareholder value. Our progress towards the completion of this
strategy is measured by KPI targets set in 2006 as outlined below, the
majority of which are either on track or exceeding their targets at this stage.
Maintaining momentum towards the 2011 business structure
Development of our high quality branded destination product: the
prudent re-examination of our capital expenditure plans has resulted
in investment in only the premier locations over the next two years.
Correspondingly, the target has been reset to achieve 74 venues
during FY2011; 
Maintaining and retaining a successful portfolio of unbranded clubs:
target 36 venues during FY2011;
Delivering our development programme with superior returns on
investment.
Improving our operational e ectiveness
Increase admissions by 5.0%;
Increase gross margin by 0.5%; 
Deliver a  6.0m central cost reduction; 
Reduce development cost per square foot to  98 per square foot for
Oceana and  88 per square foot for Liquid.
Improving our financial e ectiveness
Dividend cover of two times;
Share buy-backs of  70.0m over three years, with an ongoing return of
surplus capital to shareholders within the parameters set;
Return on investment of 25.0% post-tax.
 e successful completion of the sale of the Entertainment Division and
some additional non-core clubs in January 2007 was a transformational
deal. In 2007/08 the Group exited a further 11 properties, which generated
proceeds of  7.4m. 
On 19 October 2007 Luminar Group holdings plc replaced Luminar plc as
the listed holding company for the Group and undertook a Scheme of
Arrangement, in order to create su cient distributable reserves to
facilitate its plans for returning cash to shareholders. Following the Scheme
of Arrangement, distributable reserves of over  200.0m were created,
which is after returning  40.8m to shareholders.
On 16 April 2008 the Group exchanged contracts with Cavendish Bars
Limited for the disposal of five subsidiaries which included 26 non-core
units, the majority of which were sub-let or closed.  is e ectively
completed the streamlining of the Group which began two years ago.  e
transaction generated a net loss on disposal of  11.1m (cash cost of  7.3m
including transaction costs), excluding a  4.2m indemnity provision given
in favour of Cavendish Bars Limited, in relation to guarantee liabilities given
on leases for units sold previously. At the year end  3.5m of this indemnity

cORPORATE sOcIAl REsPONsIBIlITY
 e Group's Corporate Social Responsibility Statement is set out on 
pages 26 to 28. 
 e Group's activities are principally in the late night market for
entertaining, dancing and drinking with the sale of alcoholic drink being
a significant ancillary activity.  e Group places considerable emphasis on
developing, maintaining and monitoring policies and processes designed
to protect the well-being and welfare of customers and employees.  e
Group is also committed to taking into account the interests of the
communities in which it operates.
cuRRENT TRADINg
Our leading market position is set to strengthen as supply in the nightclub
market contracts. Luminar's assets are unrivalled in the late night sector,
well invested and supported by freehold backing.
Like-for-like sales for the first ten weeks of the financial year were up 1.9%
within the Dancing Division and up 7.5% for branded dancing.
Whilst it would be imprudent to suggest that Luminar is totally
impervious to the current economic climate, the majority of our customer
base, being aged 18-24 are non-homeowners and have a spontaneous
attitude to their social behaviour.  is, together with our leading market
position and our deep understanding and experience of the late night
market, gives us confidence that our business is di erentiated from the
drink led high street operators and has a higher degree of in-built
resilience. Accordingly, the Board is confident of delivering further progress
during the current financial year.
DIVIDEND
 e Board is pleased to announce a final dividend of 13.95 pence per
share, giving dividends for the year of 19.32 pence per share (2007:
17.20 pence per share), an increase of 12.3% from the prior year.  is gives
a dividend cover for the year of 2.3 times, which is in line with the policy of
progressively moving to a dividend cover of two times.
suMMARY
 e Group is, by a significant margin, the largest and most experienced
nightclub operator in the UK. It has strong cash flows, outstanding assets
and well-motivated, capable and experienced sta .  e Group's strategy is
being successfully implemented and we are well on track with the
programme to deliver substantial shareholder value through the share
buy-back programme.
 e Group's 2008/09 development programme is progressing well with
four new branded openings and seven refurbishments since the year end. 
Luminar is substantially through its transformation. having achieved clarity
on our strategy, we are well on the way to creating the optimal shape of
the Group. Now our energy is directed at achieving our stated operational
KPIs, delivering e ciency and hence returns.  e focus on the content of
our units will drive growth and maintain our market leadership.  e Board
is confident in the Group's future prospects.
