شهريار وزوجته شهرزاد، بريشة الرسام فرديناند كيلر سنة 1880.
ألف ليلة وليلة هو كتاب يتضمّن مجموعة من القصص التي وردت في غرب وجنوب آسيا بالإضافة إلى الحكايات الشعبية التي جُمِعت وتُرجمت إلى العربية خلال العصر الذهبي للإسلام. يعرف الكتاب في اللغة الإنجليزية كذلك بمسمى الليالي العربية، منذ أن صدرت النسخة الإنجليزية الأولى منه سنة 1706.[2]
تم جمع العمل على مدى قرون، من قِبل مؤلفين ومترجمين وباحثين من غرب ووسط وجنوب آسيا وشمال أفريقيا. تعود الحكايات إلى القرون القديمة والوسطى لكل من الحضارات العربية والفارسية والهندية والمصرية وبلاد الرافدين. معظم الحكايات كانت في الأساس قصصاً شعبية من عهد الخلافة، والبعض الآخر، وخاصة قصة الإطار، فعلى الأرجح تم استخلاصها من العمل البهلوي الفارسي «ألف خرافة» (بالفارسية: هزار أفسان) والتي بدورها اعتمدت جزئياً على الأدب الهندي.[3]
ما هو شائع في جميع النُّسخ الخاصة بالليالي هي البادئة، القصة الإطارية عن الحاكم شهريار وزوجته شهرزاد، التي أدرجت في جميع الحكايات. حيث أن القصص تنطلق أساساً من هذه القصة، وبعض القصص مؤطرة داخل حكايات أخرى، في حين تبدأ أخرى وتنتهي من تلقاء نفسها. بعض النُّسخ المطبوعة لا تحتوي سوى على بضع مئات من الليالي، والبعض الآخر يتضمن ألف ليلة وليلة أو أكثر. الجزء الأكبر من النص هو بأسلوب النثر، على الرغم من استخدام أسلوب الشعر أحياناً للتعبير عن العاطفة المتزايدة، وأحياناً تستخدم الأغاني والألغاز. معظم القصائد هي مقاطع مفردة أو رباعيّة، كما أن بعضها يكون أطول من ذلك.
هناك بعض القصص المشهورة التي تحتويها ألف ليلة وليلة، مثل "علاء الدين والمصباح السحري"، "علي بابا والأربعون لصاً"، و "رحلات السندباد البحري السبع"، كما أن هناك بعض الحكايات الشعبية في منطقة الشرق الأوسط التي تعتبر شبه مؤكدة تقريباً، وليست جزءاً من ألف ليلة وليلة الموجودة في الإصدارات العربية، ولكنها أضيفت من قبل المستشرق الفرنسي أنطوان غالان ومترجمين أوروبيين آخرين،[4] وكان أنطوان غالان قد عمل على ترجمة الكتاب إلى الفرنسية سنة 1704.[5]

نبذة[عدل]
القصة الإطارية الرئيسية لحكايات «ألف ليلة وليلة» تحكي قصة ملك يدعى شهريار، حيث بدأ الأمر عندما اكتشف الملك أن زوجة أخيه كانت خائنة وقد صُدم لذلك الأمر، وما زاد ذلك اكتشاف خيانة زوجته له أيضاً، فقد كان أمراً لا يّحتمل بالنسبة إليه، لذا قرّر إعدامها، ورأى أن جميع النساء مخطئات. تزوج الملك شهريار من العذارى، يومياً، حيث يقتل العروس ليلة العرس، قبل أن تأخذ الفرصة لتخونه. بعد فترة لم يجد الوزير الذي كان مكلفاً بتوفير عروس للملك، مزيداً من العذارى. عندها عرضت ابنته شهرزاد نفسها لتكون عروساً للملك، فوافق أبوها على مضض. في ليلة زواجهما، بدأت شهرزاد تحكي حكاية للملك ولكن لا تنهيها، حيث أثار هذا فضول الملك لسماع نهاية الحكاية، مما دفعه إلى تأجيل إعدامها للاستماع إلى نهاية الحكاية. وفي الليلة التالية، عندما تنتهي من حكاية ما تبدأ بحكاية جديدة، تشوق الملك لسماع نهايتها هي الأخرى وهكذا، حتى أكملت لديه ألف ليلة وليلة.[6]
تختلف الحكايات فهي متنوّعة، وتشمل القصص التاريخية والغرامية والتراجيدية والكوميدية، والشعرية، والخيالية، والأسطورية، بالإضافة إلى عدة أنواع من القصص الجنسية. وهناك قصص عديدة تصف الجن والغيلان والقردة،[7] كما أن هناك قصصاً عن السحرة والمشعوذين والأماكن الأسطورية، والتي غالباً ما تتداخل مع أناس حقيقيين وأماكن موجودة على أرض الواقع، ولكنها ليست دائما منطقية.
الشخصيات البارزة[عدل]
وهي تشمل الخليفة العباسي هارون الرشيد ووزيره جعفر البرمكي والشاعر الشهير أبا نواس، فعلى الرغم من أن هذه الشخصيات ظهرت بعد نحو مئتي عام من سقوط الإمبراطورية الساسانية التي هي في الظاهر أصل الحكاية إلا أنها تظهر في عدد من الحكايات الأخرى التي يتضمّنها الكتاب.[8]
في بعض الأحيان تقوم بعض الشخصيات الموجودة في حكايات شهرزاد بسرد قصص تحتوي على شخصيات أخرى، وبعض تلك القصص تحتوي على قصص أخرى بداخلها، مما ينتج نسيجاً مترابطاً من السرد الروائي.[9]
تختلف عدد من الإصدارات في تفاصيل نهاية القصة، حيث أن بعضها يذكر بأن شهرزاد تطلب العفو، والبعض الآخر يذكر بأن الملك شهريار عندما يرى أطفالهما يقرر عدم إعدامها، بينما تذهب بعض الإصدارات إلى أن الملك يبقي في حيرة من أمره، إلا أنها جميعاً تنتهي بعفو الملك شهريار عن زوجته وشهرزاد والتراجع عن عادته بقتل النساء.
أسلوب الراوي يعطي نهاية مشوّقة، وهي أوسع نطاقاً مما هي عليه في الأدب الحديث. العديد من الحالات تقطع القصة فيها حينما يكون البطل في خطر، وفي بعض أجزاء النصوص تتوقف شهرزاد في منتصف الرواية لتبيّن بعض المبادئ الفلسفية المجردة أو بعضاً من الفلسفة الإسلامية، وفي حالة واحدة قامت بوصف مفصل لعلم التشريح البشري وفقاً لجالينوس، وفي جميع هذه الحالات تريد زيادة الفضول لدى الملك لتسلسل القصص، وأملاً منها أن يبقيها على قيد الحياة لفترة أطول.[9]
تاريخ الإصدارات والترجمات[عدل]
تُرجِم كتاب ألف ليلة وليلة إلى عدّة لغات، وقد طبع بالعربية لأول مرة في ألمانيا سنة 1825م بإشراف «المستشرق هايخت» فأنجز منه ثمانية أجزاء، مع ترجمته إلى الألمانية، وتوفي قبل إتمام الكتاب، فأنجز الباقي تلميذه هاينريخ فلايشر المتوفي سنة 1888م ثم طبع مرات عدّة، أهمها طبعة مصطفى البابي الحلبي بمصر سنة 1960م. وقد عمِل محسن مهدي على توثيق النسخ العربية في عمل صدر له في ليدن سنة 1984م. هناك مجموعة من الرسومات صاحبت الترجمات الغربية لألف ليلة وليلة في كتاب (ألف ليلة وليلة: مقالات نقدية وببلوغرافية) الصادر باللغة الإنجليزية،[10] و(ديوان ألف ليلة وليلة) تحقيق عبد الصاحب العقابي: كتاب التراث الشعبي،[11] ويقع الكتاب في 577 صفحة مزودة بلوحات فنية.[12] أما مؤلف الكتاب فلا يعرف حتى الآن من هو واضع كتاب "ألف ليلة وليلة"، وقد ذهب «الشرواني» في مقدمة الطبعة الإيرانية إلى أن واضع الكتاب شامي الأصل، جعله في لغة مبسطة متوخياً تعليم اللغة العربية إلى الراغبين فيها أكثر ما توخى الاقتراب من إفهام الناس. وقد لحقه الرأي دي ساسي الذي لا يستبعد أن يكون قد زاد على الأصل السوري النقلة والحكاؤون، في كل زمان ومكان أخباراً وحكايات من عندهم.[13]
أصل الكتاب[عدل]

طبعة فارسية لكتاب ألف ليلة وليلة بين سنتي 1849 - 1856.
يميل «جوناثان سكوت» في مقدمته للطبعة الإنجليزية إلى أن واضع الكتاب أكثر من شخص، فلا يعرف البادئ ولا المتأخرون ولا تعرف جنسياتهم. أما «لانجلس» فعلى رأي «المسعودي» الذي يردّ الكتاب إلى الهند،[14] في قوله:
«وإن سبيل الأخبار سبيل الكتب المنقولة إلينا والمترجمة لنا من الفارسية والهندية والرومية، سبيل تأليفها ما ذكرنا مثل كتاب "هزار افسانه" وتفسير ذلك من الفارسية إلى العربية ألف خرافة، والخرافة بالفارسية يقال لها افسانه، والناس يسمون هذا الكتاب "ألف ليلة وليلة" وهو خبر الملك والوزير وابنته وجاريتها وهما شيرازاد ودنيازاد.»
كان «ابن النديم» صاحب الفهرست أول من عرف بالكتاب قال: «كتاب هزار افسان ومعناه ألف خرافة وكان السبب في ذلك أن ملكاً من ملوكهم كان إذا تزوج امرأة وبات معها ليلة قتلها من الغد فتزوج بجارية من أولاد الملوك ممن لها عقل ودراية يقال لها شهرزاد فلما حصلت معه ابتدأت تخرفه وتصل الحديث عند انقضاء الليل بما يحمل الملك على استبقائها ويسألها في الليلة الثانية عن تمام الحديث إلى أن أتى عليها ألف ليلة وهو مع ذلك يطأها إلى أن رزقت منه ولداً أظهرته وأوقفته على حيلتها عليه فاستعقلها ومال إليها واستبقاها وكان للملك قهرمانة يقال لها دي نار زاد فكانت موافقة لها على ذلك. وقد قيل أن هذا الكتاب ألِّف لحماني ابنة بهمن. وجاءوا فيه بخبر غير هذا»، وقال: «ويحتوي على ألف ليلة وعلى دون المائتي سمر لأن السمر ربما حدث به في عدة ليال وقد رأيته بتمامه دفعات وهو بالحقيقة كتاب غث بارد الحديث»، كما قال: «ابتدأ أبو عبد الله محمد بن عبدوس الجهشياري صاحب كتاب الوزراء بتأليف كتاب اختار فيه ألف سمر من أسمار العرب والعجم والروم وغيرهم كل جزء قائم بذاته لا يعلق بغيره وأحضر المسامرين فأخذ عنهم أحسن ما يعرفون ويحسنون واختار من الكتب المصنفة في الأسمار والخرافات ما يحلو بنفسه وكان فاضلاً فاجتمع له من ذلك أربعمائة ليلة وثمانون ليلة كل ليلة سمر تام يحتوي على خمسين ورقة وأقل وأكثر ثم عاجلته المنية قبل استيفاء ما في نفسه من تتميمه ألف سمر ورأيت من ذلك عدة أجزاء بخط أبي الطيب أخي الشافعي».[15]
يستنتج «ماكدونلد» على أن الأصل الأول لهذا الكتاب فارسي بدليل أن أولى لياليه منقولة إلى العربية عن "هزار افسانه". ويزيد «هومر» على أن "ألف ليلة وليلة" إن لم تكن فارسية فهي هندية. ثم يتفق «شليغل» و«غلدميستر» و«ديس ونجتشامبس» و«لويسلر» على إعطاء الكتاب إلى الهند، مع الإفراد للفرس وللعرب ببعض الفضل فيه، فمثلاً ورد في الليلة الرابعة والتسعين، أبيات مشهورة لمحي الدين بن عربي، وأولها: "ليت شعري لو دروا ... أي قلب ملكوا".[13]
لو كان أصل الليالي أجنبياً فارسياً على سبيل المثال لكان أبطال قصصه الأساسيون من غير المسلمين، ولكانت المدن الإيرانية، وليست بغداد والبصرة والموصل والقاهرة ودمشق وحلب، هي مسرحه.
—سامي مهدي[16][17]
لم تشتهر رواية في التراث الإنساني الأممي، كما اشتهرت "ألف ليلة وليلة" وارتبط اسمها للأبد باسمي "بغداد" و"هارون الرشيد" وباتا علامة حضارية كبرى في كل أرجاء المعمورة.
—محسن مهدي[18]
في الفارسية بعض الحكايات التي تقابل حكايات ألف ليلة وليلة، غير أن الدارسين اختلفوا في الأصل الفارسي لبعضها وأرجعوه إلى أصل هندي كقصة شهرزاد التي بنيت عليها الليالي، مستدلّين على ذلك بقصص يشبه الباعث الأول لتأليفها، وهو اكتساب الوقت وثني المتهور عن عزمه، بقصص هندية تدور حول الباعث نفسه كقصة «سوكا سابتاتي». كما أن الحكايات الهندية تكوّن سلسلة متماسكة الحلقات متعاقبة الخطوات، يتصل بعضها ببعض، فتستدعي الحكاية رواية حكاية أخرى، وهو يشبه الأسلوب المستخدم أحياناً في ألف ليلة وليلة.[19]
الحكايات في أوائل جميع النسخ المخطوطة والمطبوعة من الكتاب تمثل هذه الطريقة التي قام عليها هيكل الكتاب، وتحمل السمات القديمة للحكايات الشعبية الهندية التي وجدت طريقها إلى الفارسية ثم إلى العربية عن طريق الترجمة في أيام العصر العباسي الأول، رغم وجود كثير من التبديل والتغيير والتهويل والتكرار على الحكايات.[19]
بينما يرى آخرون خلاف ذلك ويرجعون أصل كتاب «ألف ليلة وليلة» إلى أنه كتاب عربي، ومنهم الناقد والشاعر سامي مهدي الذي ألّف كتاباً سنة 1984 بعنوان "ألف ليلة وليلة.. كتاب عراقي أصيل"، وناقش فيه أصل «ألف ليلة وليلة» كما تضمّن محتواه ردّاً على من نسبه إلى فارس أو الهند أو اليونان. كما يقول بأن فرضيّات المسعودي وابن النديم والتوحيدي الذي تبعهم، لو كانت صحيحة وكان الكتاب فارسيّاً لكان أبطال القصص من غير المسلمين، ولتمّ استخدام أسماء الملوك الفرس بدل شخصيّات مثل شخصيّة الخليفة هارون الرشيد وغيرها من الشخصيّات، كما أن استخدام مدن فارسيّة سيكون أولى من المدن العربية، ويرى بأنّ كتاب "هزار أفسانة" شيء وكتاب "ألف ليلة وليلة" شيء آخر مختلف عنه.[16][17]
الإصدارات العربية[عدل]
في منتصف القرن العشرين، وجدت الباحثة «نابية أبوط» وثيقة تحتوي على بضعة أسطر من عمل عربي يحمل عنوان «كتاب حكاية الألف ليلة» يعود تاريخها إلى القرن التاسع، والتي تعتبر أقدم جزء متبقي لنسخة عربية موجودة من الكتاب حتى الآن.[20] وأول إشارة إلى النسخة العربية والتي تحمل العنوان الكامل «ألف ليلة وليلة» ظهرت في القاهرة في القرن الثاني عشر.[21] هناك عدد من الحكايات العربية المختلفة، والتي امتدّت ما بين القرنين الرابع والعاشر الهجريين، وفي هذه الحكايات أقسام واضحة تؤلف المجموعتين البغدادية والمصرية.[19]
المجموعة البغدادية

شخصية هارون الرشيد إحدى أبرز شخصيات ألف ليلة وليلة.
المجموعة البغدادية تشمل حكايات شعبية عربية قديمة متوارثة كانت تتناقلها الأجيال بالإضافة إلى حكايات ألفها المسلمون في العصر العباسي وحوادث وسيراً تاريخية. ويذكر ابن النديم أنّ الجَهْشياري صاحب كتاب الوزراء: «ابتدأ بتأليف كتاب اختار فيه ألف سمر من أسمار العرب والعجم والروم وغيرهم. كل جزء قام بذاته، لا يعلق بغيره، وأحضر المسامرين وأخذ عنهم أحسن ما يعرفون ويحسنون، واختار من الكتب المصنفة في الأسمار والخرافات ما يحلو بنفسه، فاجتمع له من ذلك أربعمئة ليلة وثمانون ليلة، كل ليلة سمر تام يحتوي على خمسين ورقة وأقل وأكثر، ثم عاجلته المنية قبل استيفاء ما في نفسه من تتميمه ألف سمر» ويضيف ابن النديم: «وكان قبل ذلك ممن يعمل الأسمار والخرافات على ألسنة الناس والطير والبهائم جماعة منهم عبد الله بن المقفع وسهل بن هارون وعلي بن داوود». كما يذكر ابن النديم كتباً كثيرة، مؤلفة أو مترجمة من كتب الأسمار، عرفها العرب في أيام خلفاء بني العباس، ولاسيما في أيام المقتدر بالله حيث كانت الأسمار والخرافات مرغوباً فيها، فصنّف الورّاقون فيها وكذبوا. وقد تجمّعت هذه الحكايات في مدى القرنين الرابع والخامس للهجرة، مما أثر عن الرواة ودوّن في الكتب، وأضيف إليها حوادث تاريخية دخلتها زيادات وتعديلات فضلاً عن كثير من سير الشعراء والأشخاص الذين عاشوا في زمن العباسيين كأبي نواس وأبي دلامة، واستغلت تلك الحكايات والأخبار استغلالاً متنوع الغايات. وأشهر حكايات هذا القسم، حكاية "علي بن بكار وشمس النهار"، وحكاية "أنس الوجود والورد في الأكمام"، وغيرها من قصص الحب، كما تصوّر حياة النعيم والترف، وتبيّن ما وصلت إليه الحضارة في بغداد والبصرة من ترف، وتشهد على الغنى في الأسواق، وتمثل الجواري في المقاصير، وتجعل من هارون الرشيد مثالاً في العدل والصلاح.[19]
المجموعة المصرية

لوحة تصوّر حكاية "أبي قير وأبي صير"، رسمها المستشرق الفرنسي ليون كاري.
أما عن المجموعة المصرية من الحكايات فيرى كثير من الباحثين في الأدب أن صورة كتاب ألف ليلة وليلة وصلت إلى مصر في منتصف القرن الخامس الهجري تقريباً، وأن القصص ظلّ يزاد فيها على مرّ الزمن فتكوّنت المجموعة المصرية الجديدة التي تعدّ أكبر أقسام ألف ليلة وليلة، وفيها تكررت بعض الموضوعات، وإن تغيرت أسماء أبطالها ثم أُلفت قصص جديدة. تضم هذه المجموعة ما كتب من القصص في مصر أو بلاد الشام، لاتصال البلدين بصلة وثيقة أيام الفاطميين ثم المماليك والعثمانيين، وقد تألفت هذه القصص ما بين القرنين الخامس والعاشر الهجريين من القصص العربية والتقاليد الإسلامية والأساطير الشرقية. ويشير «المَقَّري» في نفح الطيب إلى أن «ابن سعيد الأندلسي الغرناطي» (المتوفي سنة 685 هـ) يذكر في كتابه «المحلى بالأشعار» ما يدل على أن كتاب ألف ليلة وليلة كان شائعاً ومعروفاً في مصر في القرنين الخامس والسادس الهجريين.
تتألف قصص ألف ليلة وليلة في المجموعة المصرية من قسمين، أحدهما قديم ينتهي في القرن الثامن الهجري، والآخر حديث ينتهي في القرن العاشر الهجري. فالقسم القديم يتمتع بأسلوب حسن مطّرد السياق مهذب العبارة، يدور حول المغامرة والحرب وتعارض الأخلاق وتضارب العواطف، وتعتمد القصص فيه على الطلاسم والأرصاد والجن والسحر والقدر، كحكاية "جودر التاجر وإخوته"، وحكاية "مسرور التاجر مع معشوقته زين المواصف"، وحكاية "علي شار مع زمرد الجارية".

أما القسم الثاني من الحكايات المصرية فأكثره ركيك الأسلوب جريء العبارة، تدور أحداثه حول حيل المحتالين ومكايد العيّارين ومخاطر اللصوص، إلى جانب قصص التصوف والزهد السائدين في المجتمع المصري آنذاك، وأشهر حكايات هذا القسم حكاية "معروف الإسكافي". وحكاية "أبي قير وأبي صير" وحكاية "مدينة النحاس" وحكاية "علي الزيبق ودليلة المحتالة" وحكاية "زينب النصابة" وحكاية "الرجل الصعيدي وامرأته الإفرنجية".[19][22][23]
المجموعات الأخرى
هناك مجموعة من القصص قد أضيفت كاملة إلى كتاب ألف ليلة وليلة، وهي ترد في نسخ دون الأخرى، وكان السبب في إضافتها ليبلغ عدد الليالي الألف، كما يدلّ على ذلك عنوان الكتاب، وأشهر هذه القصص قصة "السندباد". بالإضافة إلى مجموعة الأخبار، وهي الأخبار المنتزعة من التاريخ الماضي والتاريخ المعاصر لتلك القصص عن عجائب البلاد والخلق وأخبار الملوك وآدابهم.[19]
الترجمات الحديثة[عدل]

غلاف مصوَّر من النسخة الفرنسية (1704 - 1717) للمستشرق الفرنسي أنطوان غالان، والتي كانت قد أُصدِرت تحت عنوان «ألف ليلة وليلة، حكايات عربية تُرجِمت إلى الفرنسية».[24] تمت الرسوم بواسطة الفنان الهولندي ديفيد كوستر.
على الرغم من أن هناك إشارات على أن بداية دخول حكايات «ألف ليلة وليلة» إلى الأدب الأوروبي كانت في منتصف القرن الرابع عشر،[25] إلا أن أول ترجمة كاملة لحكايات «الف ليلة وليلة» ظهرت باللغة الفرنسية سنة 1704، والتي قام بها المستشرق أنطوان غالان.[5] وقد صدرت هذه الترجمة في اثني عشر مجلداً. لكن هذه الترجمة رغم تكاملها النسبي عانت الكثير من الحذف والبتر وخاصة للفقرات والمقاطع المنافية للأخلاق، كما أن ترجمة غالان لم تكن مطابقة للنصوص الأصلية بل كان فيها نوعاً من التصرف لتناسب اللغة الفرنسية، بما في ذلك القصائد الشعرية. كان لظهور هذه الترجمة دور في انتعاش الحياة الأدبية هناك، ثم ترجمت إلى الإنجليزية والألمانية والدنماركية.[25][26]
حينما تُرجِمت «ألف ليلة وليلة» إلى اللغة الإنجليزية انعكس تأثيرها على الأدب والشعر الإنجليزي، فتأثر بها عدد من الشعراء الإنجليز، منهم والتر سكوت، واللورد بايرون، وتوماس مور، وجون كيتس. ويبدو هذا واضحاً في ديوان اللورد بايرون "حكايات شرقية" وهو ديوان شعر رومانسي، وكذلك عند توماس مور في روايته "لالا روخ". أما في فن التصوير فقد برز هذا التأثير في لوحات ديلاكروا ودي كامب وجيروم.[25]
كذلك صدرت الترجمة الألمانية عن اللغة الفرنسية، والتي بدأت منذ عام 1710 على يد تالاندر، ولكن الألمان أصدروا ترجمة من اللغة العربية في النصف الأول من القرن التاسع عشر وذلك عن النسخة العربية التي طُبِعت في كلكتا سنة 1814، وعن النسخة المصرية طبعة بولاق في العشرينات من نفس القرن. كان من ضمن مستشرقي ألمانيا اللذين اهتموا بهذا العمل، المستشرق فردريش روكرت الذي قدم العديد من الدراسات التي تتناول هذا الموضوع مثل "مباهج وتأملات شرقية " و "سبعة كتب وأساطير وحكايات من الشرق"، ومارست «ألف ليلة وليلة» تأثيرها على الأدب الألماني، حيث أن لشتينبرج قد استعان بها في إخراج شعره الرومانسي، وكذلك جوته الشاعر الألماني الكبي الذي كان مهتماً بالشرق وآدابه وقبل «ألف ليلة وليلة» ظهر تأثره بالإسلام وشخصية محمد، وقد قام بترجمة بعض النصوص القرآنية عن ترجمة ماركيوس إلى اللغة اللاتينية، وتوالت اهتماماته إلى أن أصدر روايته الشعرية "الديوان الشرقي الغربي" ويبدو فيها تأثره بالشعر العربي والفارسي والقرآن وشعر المتصوفين خاصة جلال الدين الرومي وكذلك حكايات ألف ليلة وليلة. كما قام أوجست فون بلاتين بنظم ديوانه الشعري "العباسيون" مستوحياً إبداعه من ألف ليلة وليلة.[25]
تُرجِم العمل إلى البولندية في منتصف القرن الثامن عشر، وذلك سنة 1768 ويقع في اثني عشر مجلداً، وتمت عن ترجمة غالان، وأعيد طباعتها في 1772 - 1774. كما قام بوهموليتس بترجمة ونشر بعض القصص في مجلة مونيتور البولندية، وفي سنة 1819 نشرت ترجمة جديدة في فيلنا عن ترجمة غالان، تبعها في سنة 1873 ترجمة أخرى في وارسو، وكلها نقلت عن ترجمة غالان. في الخمسينيات صدرت بعض المختارات المترجمة عن طريق كوبياك وتوبيليفتش، ثم في عام 1959 صدرت طبعة أخرى تحتوي على عدد أكبر من المختارات ترجمها كوبياك من اللغة العربية، إلى أن تمت الترجمة البولندية الحديثة التي بدأت مع منتصف الخمسينيات حين تشكلت لجنة من أساتذة متخصصين من الأقسام الشرقية في بولندا، وعلى رأسها جامعة ياجيلونسكي متمثلة في معهد فقه اللغة، وجامعة وارسو متمثلة في قسم الدراسات العربية، عملت على نقل العمل من اللغة العربية إلى اللغة البولندية، وقد تمت الترجمة عن طريق طبعة بولاق المصرية الموجودة في أربعة مجلدات. وبالرغم من أن عملية الترجمة قد بدأت في الفترة 1957 - 1958 وانتهت مع بداية الستينيات إلا أنها لم تصدر إلا في سنة 1974، وكانت قد صدرت في طبعتين إحداهما مختصرة في مجلد واحد، والأخرى مفصلة للمهتمين وتقع في تسع مجلدات.[25][27]
أما فيما يتعلّق بالترجمة البوسنية، فقد بدأت الترجمة الأولى الكاملة في فترة حصار سراييفو، عن طريق أسعد دوراكوفيتش الذي كان قد انتخب لتوه كأول بوسنوي يكون عضواً في مجمع اللغة العربية بالقاهرة، ونشرت تلك الترجمة سنة 1999،[28][29] وقد أراد لهذا العمل أن يشكل صلة للبوسنة مع العالم العربي والإسلامي بشكل خاص ليعيد إثبات الهوية البوسنية في وجه اللغة الصربو كرواتية.[30]
المواضيع والأساليب الأدبية[عدل]
يستخدم كتاب «ألف ليلة وليلة» أساليب مختلفة وهي تختلف باختلاف قصص الكتاب كما تختلف بحسب مجموعاته، ففي المقدمة والمجموعة البغدادية يتسم غالباً كونه متين العبارة، حسن السبك، دقيق الوصف، كثير السجع، قليل الفضول، وإن كان يسفّ أحياناً ويتجرأ بالعبارة النابية عن الحشمة. وهو في المجموعة المصرية الأخيرة نسجه ضعيف، عاميّ اللفظ، فيه تهويل ممجوج، شديد الوطأة على الحياء. لكن الأسلوب العام للكتاب يتميّز بالوضوح والتشويق،[31] ويتراوح بين الفصحى والعاميّة. كما يحتوي الكتاب على بعض الأشعار التي تتخلل بعض القصص، ولكنها تفتقر أحياناً إلى الوزن السليم، وقد استخدمت الأشعار أحياناً لغرض تطويل القصة أو للتأثير في السامعين.[19]
القصة الإطارية[عدل]

شهرزاد وهي تروي حكاياتها للملك شهريار.
تتألف «ألف ليلة وليلة» من القصة الإطارية، والحكايات الفرعية التي تولدت عنها. فالقصة الإطارية الأساسية تدور حول ملك يدعى شهريار الذي قرر أن يتزوج امرأة كل ليلة ثم يقتلها مع بزوغ الفجر وذلك بعد أن عملت زوجته على خيانته، وظل على هذه الحال إلى أن تزوج من شهرزاد ابنة الوزير التي أخذت تروي له حكايات في كل ليلة طمعاً في أن يبقي على حياتها.[32] هناك عدد من الحكايات التي بدورها تتضمن حكايات أخرى، وبالتالي فهي تكون على شكل قصة إطارية للحكايات الضمنية، ويلاحظ بأن القصة الإطارية عبارة عن حكاية بسيطة تتضمّن القليل من الأحداث والشخصيات، وهذا التركيب البسيط هو الذي جعلها تتصف بميزة القدرة على احتواء حكايات كثيرة فيها، إذ ما تتسم به الحكاية الخرافية عامة هو وجود أجزاء رخوة في الفعل القصصي، يسمح باندراج أفعال قصصية ثانوية في سياقها، تنشأ باستمرار. أما الحكايات الفرعية فهي التي روتها شهرزاد عن رواة آخرين، وهي حكايات عديدة ومتنوعة. كانت شهرزاد تتوقف عن رواية الحكاية في كل ليلة، لتكملها للملك شهريار في الليلة المقبلة إذ أنه عفا عنها.[33]
أسلوب السرد[عدل]
يعمل أسلوب سرد حكايات «ألف ليلة وليلة» على دفع المتلقي إلى زمنٍ قديم، لذلك كان استخدام صيغة «يُحكى» والتي تعقبها عبارة «والله اعلم بغيبه وأحكم» تعتبر صيغة للتخلص من تبعات نقل النص وسنده ومتنه، بخلاف كتب الحديث والأدب والتاريخ التي اعتنت بهذه الأمور. إذ أن العمل يعتبر نص أدبي متخيل ومصنوع حيث يحمل بين طياته الكثير من الموقف والرؤى والاتجاهات، وباعتباره متخيلاً فإن هذه المواقف هي انعكاس لوجهة نظر منتج النص، لذلك كان الراوي المصطنع وسيلة للتخلص من هذه التبعية حيث يلقى له مهمة السرد والحكي، فلذلك وجِدت صيغة «يحكى أن» التي تحيل إلى المجهول الذي يتحمل كافة المسؤولية عن كل ما سيقال ضمن النص المروي. تبدأ حكاية «ألف ليلة وليلة» على المستوى السردي براوٍ مجهول، جرى تحميله مسؤولية ما سيقال، لذلك كانت «يحكى أن» الأنسب للحيلولة دون أن تلقى المسؤولية على شخص ما. فالفعل يحكى عبارة عن فعل مضارع مبني للمجهول وفاعله غير معلوم، وهذا تمهيد ليتحول السرد إلى راوٍ آخر ولكن ضمن الإطار الداخلي للنص أو القصة التي يعتبر ساردها الكلي غير معلوم. فشهرزاد تتخذ على المستوى السردي دورين، دور السارد الداخلي القائم بمهمة السرد، ودور الشخصية المشاركة في الحدث. إذ أن الحكاية الأولى من حكايات شهرزاد، تتم عبر راوٍ خارجي وهو الراوي المجهول، حيث تبدأ الحكاية بعبارة: "قالت شهرزاد: بلغني أيها الملك السعيد أنه كان تاجر من التجار ..."، فأسلوب السرد هذا يشير إلى أن هناك شخص آخر يتحدث، ولكنه سرعان ما يختفي عندما يظهر صوت شهرزاد تقول: "بلغني أيها الملك السعيد" لينتقل السرد على المستوى العملي إلى شهرزاد. إن السرد الذي تمارسه شهرزاد بعناية وحذر شديدين يعتبر سرد خطير، لأنه يحمل بين طياته موتها الحتمي، ما لم تتمكن من جذب انتباه الملك شهريار إلى حديثها، لذلك فهي تلجأ إلى عبارة «بلغني» وهذه العبارة تخلص شهرزاد من تبعات ما تقول إذ لم يعجب الملك حديثها.[34]

هناك بعض الشخصيات أو الأمور الواردة في «ألف ليلة وليلة» والتي تتم الإشارة إليها بشكل متكرر، حيث تبدو غير مهمة عند الإشارة إليها في أول مرة ولكنها فجأة تظهر لاحقاً في السرد.[35] كما أن هناك أسلوب آخر هو الشكل والنمط العام وما يحتويه من تنظيم للوقائع والأفعال والإيماءات التي تشكل السرد وتعطي شكلاً للقصة، وهذا يعمل على جعل المتلقي يتمتع بالقصة ويتوقع كيفية سير الرواية. يعود تاريخ هذه الأسلوب أيضا إلى «ألف ليلة وليلة».[36] شكل آخر من أشكال التكهّن هو أن النبوءة تحقق ذاتها، وهو أسلوب يعود تاريخه إلى قصة «كريشنا» في الأدب السنسكريتي القديم، وهناك اختلاف بينه وبين أسلوب أن الحلم نفسه يتحقق، والذي يعود تاريخه إلى الأدب العربي في القرون الوسطى. العديد من حكايات «ألف ليلة وليلة» تستخدم هذا الأسلوب المتمثل بالتنبؤ بما سيحدث. من أبرز الأمثلة على ذلك قصة "‬الرجل الذي‮ ‬أصبح‮ ‬غنياً‮ ‬من خلال حلم"، وتدور أحداث القصة حول رجل يُطلب منه في حلمه مغادرة مدينته بغداد والسفر إلى القاهرة، حيث توجد بعض الكنوز المخبأة هناك. الرجل يسافر هناك ولكن لسوء حظه ينتهي به الأمر إلى السجن، حيث يروي حلمه لضابط الشرطة، ولكن الضابط يسخر من فكرة هذه الأحلام، ويحكي للرجل بطل الرواية أنه هو نفسه كان يحلم بمنزل مع فناء ونافورة في بغداد، حيث أن الكنز مدفون تحت النافورة. يتعرف الرجل على المكان كما أنه بيته، وبعد إطلاق سراحه من السجن يعود إلى منزله ويحفر من أجل الكنز. وبعبارة أخرى، فإن الحلم لم يكن توقع للمستقبل فحسب، بل إنه كان سبباً في جعل الأمر حقيقياً. ظهر أسلوب هذه القصة لاحقاً في الأدب الغربي، من بينها عمل باولو كويلو في "الخيميائي".[37]
التكرار والتجسيد الدرامي[عدل]

أصبحت الملكة شيرين شخصية بارزة لما عُرِفت عنه من صبر وتفهُّم.
أسلوب التكرار في العمل الأدبي عادة ما يعبر عن فكرة أو موضوع مهم لقصة معينة، وهذا الأسلوب مستخدم في «ألف ليلة وليلة»، الذي يربط عدة حكايات في سياق القصة. حيث اعتمد رواة القصص في حكاياتهم على ربط الشخصيات بشكل متماسك.[31] كما اعتمد الكتاب على أسلوب النمط الموضوعي الذي يعمل على توزيع المفاهيم الموضوعية المتكررة وعن القيم الأخلاقية بين مختلف الأحداث والقصص الإطارية. في الحكايات التي تمت صياعتها بمهارة، وربما تم تنظيم النمط الموضوعي بغرض التأكيد على توحيد الحجة أو الفكرة المتضمنة في الأحداث ولا سيما القصص الإطارية لها. يعود تاريخ هذا الأسلوب أيضا إلى ألف ليلة وليلة أو حتى قبل ذلك.[36] تظهر عدة قصص مختلفة بديلة عن قصة "سندريلا" والتي يرجع أصلها إلى القصة المصرية القديمة "رادوبيس". حيث يحتوي الكتاب على عدد من القصص وكلها تتمحور حول أخ صغير يلقى مضايقات من قبل أخوين غيورين يكبرانه سناً. في بعض القصص يكون الأشقاء من الإناث، بينما في قصص أخرى يكونون من الذكور. في واحدة من الحكايات والواردة تحت عنوان "جودر التاجر وإخوته"، يختلف فيها الأمر وتحيد عن أسلوب النهايات السعيدة وتختلف عن سابقتها، فقد عُمِل على جعل نهايتها مأساوية بدلاً من ذلك، حيث يتم تسميم الأخ الأصغر من قِبل إخوته.[38]
التجسيد أو التصوير الدرامي هو تقديم شخصية أو شئ ما بوصف مفصّل، أو عن طريق إيماءات وحركات كطريقة من شأنها أن تجعل المشهد وكأنه مرئي للمتلقي. هذه التقنية تعود إلى «ألف ليلة وليلة»، وتعتبر قصة «التفاحات الثلاث» إحدى الأمثلة على ذلك.[36]
أدب الجريمة[عدل]
احتوى كتاب «ألف ليلة وليلة» في بعض القصص على أسلوب أدب الجريمة في الطرح، حيث يظهر ذلك في قصة "الصبية المقتولة" (وتعرف كذلك بقصة "التفاحات الثلاث")،[39] فهي تعطي مثالاً على موضوع الإثارة والجريمة،[40] مع الكثير من الحبكة القصصية،[41] والأدب البوليسي.[42] في هذه القصة، يحوز هارون الرشيد على صندوق وعندما يفتحه، يجد بأنه يحتوي على جثة امرأة شابة. عندها يكلّف هارون الرشيد وزيره جعفر بمهمة العثور على الجاني، ويمهله ثلاثة أيام لذلك وإلا فإنه سوف يعدمه. بعد ذلك وفي نهاية الأيام الثلاثة وعندما يكون جعفر على وشك الحكم عليه بالموت لفشله بتنفيذ المهمّة الموكلة إليه، يأتي شخصان ويدعيان بأنهما هما من قتلاها. في خلال روايتهما للقصة يتبين بأنه على الرغم من كون الشخص الأصغر سناً منهما وهو نفسه زوج المرأة هو المتسبب في موتها، فهناك بعض اللوم يقع على العبد، الذي كان قد أخذ إحدى التفاحات الثلاث وتسبب في قتل المرأة. عندها يعطي هارون الرشيد ثلاثة أيام أخرى جعفر لكي يعثر على ذلك العبد المذنب، ولكنه يفشل مرة أخرى في العثور على الجاني، عندها يقرر توديع عائلته قبل إعدامه، ولكنه عن طريق الصدفة يلاحظ بأن ابنته لديها تفاحة كانت قد حصلت من العبد الخاص به "ريحان"، وهكذا يتم حل اللغز.
هناك حكاية أخرى يحتويها الكتاب في موضوع أدب الجريمة وهي حكاية "الخياط والأحدب واليهودي والمباشر والنصراني" حيث كانت مليئة بالإثارة والتشويق ولكن بقالب كوميدي، على عكس حكاية "الصبية المقتولة"، التي كان يغلب عليها طابع لغز الجريمة أو الأدب البوليسي. وملخص القصة التي تجري أحداثها في الصين، تبدأ بالمهرّج المفضل لدى السلطان، الذي تمت دعوته إلى عشاء من قبل الخياط وزوجته. وفي أثناء العشاء يغصّ الأحدب بطعامه من كثرة الضحك، فيخشى الزوجين من غضب السلطان، فيقرران أخذه إلى بيت الطبيب اليهودي وتركه هناك. هذا الأمر يؤدي إلى حكاية أخرى تتمثل بالطبيب اليهودي، حيث وأنه عن طريق الخطأ يتعثر بجثة الأحدب ويقع معه أسفل الدرج، ويجده ميتاً، مما يجعله يعتقد بأن هذا السقوط هو الذي أدى إلى موت الأحدب. ثم تستمر الحكاية هكذا إلى تنتهي باثني عشرة حكاية في المجموع، مما يؤدي بجميع هؤلاء الأشخاص الذين شاركوا في هذا الحادث يجدون أنفسهم في قاعة المحكمة، كل منهم يروي قصته حول كيفية موت الأحدب.[43]
أدب الرعب[عدل]

تمت الإشارة إلى الغول في عدد من حكايات «ألف ليلة وليلة»، ويرجح بأنه أقدم كتاب موجود يذكر هذا المخلوق الخرافي.
استخدمت الأرواح الشريرة كأداة في العديد من الأعمال الأدبية الخاصة بالرعب وكذلك في الأدب القوطي، إلا أن الأسلوب المستخدم في قصص الرعب ضمن حكايات «ألف ليلة وليلة» يعتبر سابقاً في هذا المجال، فهناك العديد من قصص الجن والعفاريت والمساخيط والملاعين والموتى الأحياء وضحايا تناسخ الأرواح والوحوش والمسوخ والشياطين.[44]
من القصص التي استخدمت هذا الأسلوب حكاية "علي المصري والكنز في بغداد" والتي تدور أحداثها حول منزل مسكون بالجن،[45] حيث يُطلق على ذلك المنزل اسم "بيت الأموات". [46] كما أنه من المرجّح أن «ألف ليلة وليلة» هو أقدم كتاب باقٍ حتى الآن تتم الإشارة فيه إلى الكائن الخرافي الغول، حيث أن العديد من القصص الخاصة بالغول تكون الأحداث فيها إما بمقابلة الغول أو بمجرد ذكره فقط.[47] بالإضافة إلى وجود عدد من العناصر الأخرى الخاصة بأدب الرعب التي تم استخدامها في حكايات الكتاب، منها ما هو على سبيل المثال في حكاية "مدينة النحاس" والتي تدور أحداثها حول مدينة أشباح.[48] عملت الأساليب والعناصر الخاصة بأدب الرعب في ألف ليلة وليلة على التأثير في أعمال عدد من الكُتّاب، ومنهم هوارد فيليبس لافكرافت الذي ينسب الفضل في بعض إبداعاته إلى "ألف ليلة وليلة".[49]
الفانتازيا والخيال العلمي[عدل]

بساط الريح أحد الأمور الخيالية التي برزت في حكايات «ألف ليلة وليلة».

جنِّي المصباح يظهر لعلاء الدين ووالدته.
العديد من القصص الواردة في «ألف ليلة وليلة» تتميز بوجود عنصر الخيال العلمي المتقدم. هناك مثال على ذلك هو "حكاية بلوقيا" التي وردت في الليلة 486، حيث أن مساعي بطل الرواية بلوقيا في الحصول على عشبة الخلود تقوده إلى استكشاف البحار، ورحلة إلى الجنة والجحيم، والسفر عبر الكون إلى عوالم مختلفة أكبر بكثير من عالمه، وقد استخدم في الحكاية عدد من عناصر الخيال العلمي الخاص بالمجرات.[50] كما أنه في طريقه يصادف مجتمعات خاصة بالجن،[51] وحوريات البحر، والحيَّات الناطقة، وكذلك الأشجار الناطقة، وغيرها من أشكال الحياة.[50] وفي حكاية "أبي الحسن وجاريته تودّد"، تكون البطلة فيها تودّد التي تقوم فيها بمناظرة عن عدد من الأمور، ومن ضمنها الحديث عن منازل القمر، والجوانب الخيرة والشريرة من الكواكب.[52]
في حكاية أخرى من حكايات «ألف ليلة وليلة» وبالتحديد حكاية "عبد الله البري مع عبد الله البحري"، يكتسب فيها بطل الرواية عبد الله البري القدرة على التنفس تحت الماء وهو ما يساعده في اكتشاف المجتمع الموجود تحت الماء، حيث يجد بأن ذلك المجتمع مختلف تماماً عن الموجود على سطح الأرض، فهو لا يهتم بعدة مفاهيم مثل المال والملابس فهي لا وجود لها هناك. كما أن هناك حكايات أخرى يتضمنها الكتاب تصوّر مجتمعات أمازونيات التي تهيمن عليها النساء، والتقنيات القديمة المفقودة، وكذلك الحضارات القديمة المتطورة التي ذهبت، والكوارث التي حلّت بها.[53] حكاية "مدينة النحاس" تضم مجموعة من الرحّالة الذي يقومون برحلة استكشافية أثرية[54] عبر الصحراء للعثور على المدينة القديمة المفقودة، كما أن تلك المنطقة كانت تستخدم كمحبس للجن من عهد النبي سليمان،[55] وفي طريقهم وجدوا سكاناً متحجرين،[56] وعدد من الأمور الغريبة الأخرى،[57][58] المدينة التي أصبحت فيما بعد مدينة أشباح.[48] أيضاً هناك حكاية "الحصان المسحور الأبنوسي" التي تتحدث عن حصان بإمكانه الطيران.[59] بعض التفسيرات الحديثة ترى بأن هذا الحصان هو عبارة عن روبوت.[58] وقد أثرت هذه القصة في عددا من الحكايات الأوروبية، منها ما ورد في حكايات كانتربري من تأليف جيفري تشوسر.[60] تعتبر حكايتي "مدينة النحاس" و "الحصان المسحور الأبنوسي" من الأمثلة القديمة في أدب الخيال العلمي.[58][61]
بالإضافة إلى أن أدب الخيال والفانتازيا في «ألف ليلة وليلة» استخدم عدد من العناصر والأدوات السحرية مثل «المصباح السحري أو مصباح علاء الدين»، و«الخاتم السحري أو خاتم سليمان»، و«بساط الريح»، وغيرها من الأمور.[62]
الشعر العربي في ألف ليلة وليلة[عدل]

مخطوطة محفوظة من «ألف ليلة وليلة»، ذكرت فيها بعض الأبيات.
هناك العديد من القصائد الشعرية في «ألف ليلة وليلة»، حيث أنها تتخلل عدداً من الأحداث في الحكايات، وهي تغطي العديد من الأمور، ولكن أبرزها يكمن في حمد الله وتعظيم أصحاب النفوذ. بالإضافة إلى ذلك تستخدم في تقديم المشورة والتحذير وطرح الحلول، وكذلك التوسل من أجل الرحمة والمغفرة، والتحسّر من القرارات الخاطئة أو سوء الحظ، وانتقاد أسلوب المعيشة، والتعبير عن المشاعر سواء للشخص ذاته أو الآخرين من حوله وتكون تلك المشاعر بجميع أشكالها من سعادة وحزن ونحوها، كما يستخدم الشعر في طرح الأحاجي والألغاز ونحوها من الأسئلة والتحديات. لكن بعض الأشعار تفتقر أحياناً إلى الوزن السليم، وقد استخدمت بعضها لغرض تطويل القصة أو للتأثير في السامعين.[19]
هناك أحد الأمثلة التي يكون الشخص فيه معبّراً عن شعووره بالسعادة، هو ما يرد في الليلة الثالثة بعد المئتين في حكاية الأمير قمر الزمان،[63] حيث يكون واقفاً خارج القلعة يريد إبلاغ الملكة بدر البدور بوصوله، فيلفّ خاتمه في ورقة ويسلمه للخادم الذي يعمل على إيصاله إلى بدر البدور، وعندما يصل إليها تفتحه وترى الخاتم، فتفرح فرحاً شديداً، عندها تنشد هذه الأبيات:[64]
وَلَقـدْ نَدِمْـتُ عَلى تَفَرُّقِ شَمْــلِنا		دَهْـرَاً وّفاضَ الدَّمْـعُ مِنْ أَجْفـاني
وَنَـذَرْتُ إِنْ عـادَ الزَّمـانُ يَلُمـُّـنا		لا عُـدْتُ أَذْكُــرُ فُرْقَــةً بِلِســاني
هَجَـمَ السُّــرورُ عَلَـيَّ حَتَّـى أَنَّهُ		مِـنْ فَـرَطِ مـا سَــرَّني أَبْكــــاني
يا عَيْنُ صـارَ الدَّمْـعُ مِنْكِ سِجْيَةً		تَبْكيــنَ مِـنْ فَـــرَحٍ وَأَحْزانـــــي

أثَّر كتاب «ألف ليلة وليلة» بشكل كبير جداً على الأدب العالمي، وقد أشار عدد من الكتّاب مثل هنري فيلدنغ ونجيب محفوظ إلى مجموعة قصص «ألف ليلة وليلة» في أعمالهم. بالإضافة إلى كُتّاب آخرون استوحوا أعمالهم من الكتاب، منهم جون بارث، خورخي لويس بورخيس، سلمان رشدي، أورخان باموق، يوهان فولفغانغ فون غوته، والتر سكوت، وليم ثاكري، ويلكي كولينز، إليزابيث غاسكل، شارل نوديه، جوستاف فلوبير، ستندال، ألكسندر دوما، جيرار دي نرفال، آرثر دو غوبينو، ألكسندر بوشكين، ليو تولستوي، هوجو فون هوفمانستال، آرثر كونان دويل، ويليام بتلر ييتس، هربرت جورج ويلز، قسطنطين كفافيس، إيتالو كالفينو، جورج بيريك، هوارد فيليبس لافكرافت، مارسيل بروست، أنتونيا سوزان بيات، أنجيلا كارتر.[65]
هناك شخصيات عديدة وردت في «ألف ليلة وليلة» أصبحت رموزاً بارزة في الثقافة الغربية، أبرز تلك الشخصيات علاء الدين وسندباد وعلي بابا. كما ساهمت بعض من الحكايات في معرفة بعض الأمور التاريخية والجغرافية للمنطقة. بالإضافة إلى الكائنات العجيبة التي أصبحت مادة في القصص الخيالية وأضحت جزءاً من عالم الخيال، وتزيد أهمية تلك المخلوقات حينما تنتمي إلى عصور وأماكن حقيقية. هناك عدد من الأساطير العربية والفارسية شائعة في الفانتازيا وأدب الخيال الحديث، مثل الجن والبساط الطائر والمصابيح السحرية، وغيرها من الأمور. عندما اقترح ليمان فرانك بوم كتابة قصة خرافة حديثة، أزاح عدد من العناصر النمطية، وأضاف عناصر مثل الجني والقزم، فأصبحت صورة نمطية لغيرها من الأعمال.[66]
في سنة 1982 بدأ الاتحاد الفلكي الدولي بتسمية التضاريس الواقعة على إنسيلادوس (أحد أقمار كوكب زحل) تيمنًا بأسماء شخصيات وأماكن من ترجمة ريتشارد فرانسيس برتون لكتاب ألف ليلة وليلة.[67]
في الثقافة العربية[عدل]

أُطلق اسم "أنس الوجود" إحدى شخصيات ألف ليلة وليلة على جزيرة فيلة.[68] اللقطة لكشك تراجان بالجزيرة.
يعتبر كتاب «ألف ليلة وليلة» من أثمن كتب التراث العربي وأكثرها أهمية، إلا أنه وعلى الرغم من ذلك لم يرد ذكره كثيراً في المخطوطات التي عثر عليها وتعود لما قبل القرن الثامن عشر الميلادي.[69] كانت مكانة أدب الخيال منخفضة بين العرب في العصور الوسطى مقارنة بالشعر الذي كان منتشراً، وهمّشت الحكايات باعتبارها خُرافات.[70]
عمل عدد من كتاب الروايات العربية المتأثرين بألف ليلة وليلة على تجديد وتحديث الخطاب الروائي العربي وإدخال تقنيات متعددة لم تتوقف عند حد معيّن بدءاً من الشخصيات الإشكالية وفضاءات التخييل وأجواء السحر والنسق الزماني والمكاني المتقطع وصيغة الراوي والمخاطب والحواريات الشائقة بين مختلف شخصيات الحكايات.[71] في التاريخ الحديث أصبح كتاب «ألف ليلة وليلة» مصدر إلهام لعدد من الكُتّاب مثل توفيق الحكيم (مسرحية شهرزاد)، وطه حسين (أحلام شهرزاد)،[72] ونجيب محفوظ (ليالي ألف ليلة)،[73] والطيب صالح (رواية بندر شاه).[71] حالياً هناك مساعٍ حثيثة في العمل على إعادة إحياء هذا العمل الأدبي.[74]
كما أن هناك عدد من المواقع التي برز فيها أسماء لشخصيات ألف ليلة وليلة، لعلّ من أبرزها جزيرة فيلة التي أطلق عليها اسم "أنس الوجود" نسبة إلى شخصية أنس الوجود التي ظهرت في حكايات «ألف ليلة وليلة»، حيث ظهرت الشخصية في حكاية «أنس الوجود مع محبوبته الورد في الأكمام».[68] بالإضافة إلى وجود مواقع أخرى تحمل اسم شخصية علاء الدين، حيث توجد "مملكة علاء الدين" الترفيهية في الدوحة التي تم افتتاحها سنة 1994،[75] بالإضافة إلى مشروع "مدينة علاء الدين" في دبي.[76]
تأثيرها على الأدب الأوروبي المبكّر[عدل]
على الرغم من أن الترجمة الأولى المعروفة لكتاب «ألف ليلة وليلة» في لغة أوروبية ظهرت سنة 1704، إلا أنه من الممكن قد بدأ تأثير الكتاب على الثقافة الغربية قبل ذلك بكثير، ويعود السبب إلى أن الكتاب المسيحيين في العصور الوسطى في إسبانيا ترجموا العديد من الأعمال من اللغة العربية والتي تركزت معظمها في مجالات الفلسفة والرياضيات، ولكن كان هناك أيضاً من بين الأعمال عدد من الروايات العربية، كما يتضح ذلك من مجموعة قصص دون خوان مانويل "الكونت لوكانور"، وكذلك رامون لول في "كتاب الوحوش".[77] كما تم التعرف على العمل سواء كان ذلك بشكل مباشر أو غير مباشر، ويبدو أنه بدأ ينتشر خارج إسبانيا. هناك بعض المواضيع والأشكال في "حكايات كانتربري" لجيفري تشوسر التي تشبه إلى حد كبير تلك الموجودة في «ألف ليلة وليلة»، و"ديكاميرون" بقلم جيوفاني بوكاتشيو. كما أن هنالك إشارات في أعمال مثل "نوفيل" لجيوفاني سيركامبي، و"أورلاندو فوريوسو" لأريوستو، بأن قصة شهريار وشاه زمان كانت معروفة أيضاً.[78] كما أن هناك دلائل أيضا بأن القصص انتشرت في البلقان وكانت ترجمة «ألف ليلة وليلة» إلى الرومانية موجودة في القرن السابع عشر، المبنية في الأساس على النسخة اليونانية من المجموعة.[79]
الأدب الغربي من القرن الثامن عشر حتى الآن[عدل]

نشأت شهرة «ألف ليلة وليلة» الحديثة في العالم الغربي من الترجمة الأوروبية الأولى التي عمل عليها أنطوان غالان، والتي ظهرت سنة 1704.[80] حصدت نسخة غالان نجاحاً كبيراً بين الجمهور الفرنسي، وقد يكون ذلك لأنه تزامن مع رواج للقصص الخرافية في تلك الفترة. هذا النجاح انتشر في جميع أنحاء أوروبا، وبحلول نهاية القرن أصبحت هناك ترجمات لهذا العمل إلى الإنجليزية والألمانية والإيطالية والهولندية والدنماركية والروسية والفلمنكية واليديشية.[81] عملت نسخة غالان على تحفيز عدد من الكُتّاب على تقليد الأسلوب الشرقي، ولكن في الوقت نفسه، بدأ بعض الكتاب الفرنسيين العمل في روياتهم إلى محاكاة ساخرة بأسلوب شرقي سطحي وعملوا على تلفيق عدد من التي يصعب تصديقها، والتي غالباً ما ترد فيه إشارات ضمنية إلى المجتمع الفرنسي نفسه المعاصر لتلك الفترة. من أبرز الأمثلة وأكثرها شهرة هو (كتاب التنوير: Zadig) لفولتير الذي صدر سنة 1748.[82] الإصدارات الإنجليزية للحكايات الشرقية عادة ما يرد فيها عنصر الوعظ،[83] كما أن هناك أعمال مختلفة أخرى من أبرزها رواية (الواثق: Vathek) لويليام بيكفورد سنة 1786، والتي كان لها تأثير كبير على تطور الرواية القوطية. هناك أيضاً للنبيل البولندي «يان بوتوتسكي» رواية (مخطوطة وجِدت في سرقسطة: Manuscrit trouvé à Saragosse) والتي بدأت سنة 1797، التي استوحى فيها الكاتب وبشكل عميق من «ألف ليلة وليلة» مع نكهته الشرقية وأسلوب التسلسل المعقد للحكايات المضمنة.[84][85]
كان كتاب «ألف ليلة وليلة» هو الكتاب المفضّل للعديد من الكُتّاب البريطانيين في الحقبة الرومانسية والفيكتورية. أشارت بذلك أنتونيا سوزان بيات حين قالت: «برز كتاب ألف ليلة وليلة في الشعر الرومانسي البريطاني وجعل الإبداع بدل البساطة، والخيال بدل المبتذل.».[86] كان صامويل تايلر كولريدج وتوماس دي كوينسي حين كتاباتهم لسيرهم الذاتية قد أشاروا إلى الكوابيس التي جاءتهم بسبب الكتاب عندما كانوا صغاراً. كما كتب أيضاً ويليام ووردزوورث وألفريد تنيسون في أشعارهم عن قراءتهم للحكايات في أيام الطفولة.[87] كما أن عشق تشارلز ديكنز لكتاب «ألف ليلة وليلة» جعله يضفي جو الكتاب على افتتاحية روايته الأخيرة "لغز إدوين درود" سنة 1870.[88] هناك العديد من الكُتّاب اللذين حاولوا إضافة حكاية الليلة الثانية بعد الألف إلى الكتاب،[89] ومنهم تيوفيل غوتيه سنة 1842،[72] وإدغار آلان بو سنة 1850،[90] وجوزيف روث سنة 1939.[89] كما أن هناك عدد من المؤلفين في التاريخ الحديث والمعاصر اللذين تأثروا بكتاب ألف ليلة وليلة، منهم جيمس جويس، ومارسيل بروست، وخورخي لويس بورخيس، وجون بارث.[90][91][92][93]
في السينما والتلفزيون[عدل]

هناك العديد من الأفلام والمسلسلات التلفزيونية والرسوم المتحركة التي استوحت أعمالها كليّاً أو جزئياً من حكايات «ألف ليلة وليلة»، وقد كانت بداية هذه الأعمال مع جورج ميلييس "قصر ألف ليلة وليلة" سنة 1905، وقد برز فيلم الرسوم المتحركة علاء الدين من إنتاج شركة ديزني والذي بدأت سلسلته سنة 1992، ليصبح الفيلم الأكثر شهرة من بين الأعمال التي استوحت قصتها من «ألف ليلة وليلة». كما أن هناك أعمال أخرى منها نسختين لفيلم "لص بغداد"، إحداها سنة 1924 من إخراج راؤول والش، والأخرى سنة 1940 من إنتاج ألكسندر كوردا، ومن بين الأعمال أيضاً «زهرة ألف ليلة وليلة» للمخرج بيير باولو بازوليني سنة 1974.[94][95]

بعد ترجمة كتاب «ألف ليلة وليلة» عن طريق جالان وما تلاها من ترجمات، كثرت الرسوم التزيينيّة أو التوضيحيّة التي رافقت معظم طبعات تلك الترجمات، وقد عكف على وضع تلك اللوحات رسامون ومصوّرون ونحاتون، لاحقاً انتقل تأثير «ألف ليلة وليلة» على النحت والخزف وغيرها من الفنون، عبر ظاهرة الاستشراق التي نشطت وزاد حراكها، عقب تعرف الأوروبيين على «الليالي».[109]
برز العديد من الفنانين التشكيليين في تصوير حكايات ألف ليلة وليلة في أعمالهم، منهم ديلاكروا، بول كلي، كاند ينسكي، بيكاسو، ماتيس وغيرهم. تناول الفنانين في أعمالهم المساجد والحارات والفروسية والصحاري والطبيعة والإنسان العربي والمدن كالقدس ودمشق والقاهرة وبغداد وبيروت إضافة إلى تصوير القيان والحريم ومشاهد الطرب. سافر الفنان الفرنسي ديلاكروا إلى طنجة ومكناس بالمغرب وإلى وهران بالجزائر ليضفي تفاصيل البيئة العربية على لوحاته، ومن أبرز أعماله لوحة "نساء الجزائر" سنة 1834 من وحي ألف ليلة وليلة، بالإضافة إلى لوحة "الحرية تقود الشعب" التي رسمها سنة 1830، ولوحة "سلطان المغرب" سنة 1845.[110][111]
كذلك استوحى عدد من الفنانين أعمالهم من «ألف ليلة وليلة»، ومنهم أوجست رينوار، وهنري ماتيس، وإنجر، ودي كامب، حيث رسموا الجواري والجميلات، كما استوحى فان دونجن لوحته "راقصة شرقية"، وشكّل إنج تيسييه لوحات فنية زيتية مستوحاة من شخصية شهرزاد، كما أن هناك اللوحة الشهيرة "الحمّام التركي" للفنان الفرنسي جان آنغر، وكذلك لوحة "الوصيفة الكبرى"، أما لوحة "الوصيفة ذات السروال الأحمر" فهي للفنان ماتيس. كان الرسام الدنماركي كيي راسموس نيلسن ممن تأثر بشخصية شهرزاد، حيث خصّها بلوحة وهي تحكي حكاياتها للملك شهريار، كما رسم عشرين لوحة بألوان الجواش مستوحاة من «ألف ليلة وليلة» في الفترة ما بين 1918 – 1922م، ويتضح في لوحاته تأثره بالمنمنمات الفارسية. من أشهر اللوحات التي جسدت المرأة كذلك لوحة "بعد الشروق في مصر" للمستشرق ويليام هولمان هنت.[111]
أما الرسام والنحات جان ليون جيروم فيعدّ أبرز المستشرقين الذين قدموا إلى الشرق في القرن التاسع عشر ومجموعة رسوماته تتناول أساطير تاريخية إغريقية وشرقية، وقد قام برحلة طويلة سنة 1868 إلى مصر وآسيا الصغرى، وزار في القاهرة الجوامع الأثرية وصور الكثير من العمارة الإسلامية، ولعل أشهر لوحاته المستلهمة من ألف ليلة لوحاته "سوق الرقيق"، و"حمّام الحريم"، و"امرأة شرقية"، ولوحته "الملك كاودوليس". كما تأثر الرسام الأمريكي روبرت سوين جيفورد بحكاية السندباد البحري عن حادثة كسر بعض التجار لبيضة الرخ الطائر الخرافي العملاق فعمل على لوحته "بيضة الرخ" سنة 1874، وهي بالألوان المائية على الورق ومعروضة في متحف فرانسورث للفن.[111]
قام الرسام هنري جستس فورد برسم لوحته "التاجر والعفريت" سنة 1898 ضمن مجموعة تحتوي على لوحات أخرى توضح الحكايات وهي منفذة بأسلوب الحفر وهي مستلهمة من حكاية تحمل نفس الاسم في حكايات «ألف ليلة وليلة». كما برع الفنان الأمريكي ماكسفيلد باريش في استخدام الألوان وخلق عوالم فانتازية، وفي توظيف اللون الأزرق الذي يميز لوحاته بظلاله المختلفة والمتدرجة من اللازوردي والنيلي والأزرق، وقد ظهرت رسوماته الإيضاحية في كثير من الروايات أشهرها «ألف ليلة وليلة» و«سندريلا».[111]
كذلك الفنان السويسري التجريدي بول كلي الذي تمسك بأسلوب فردي تتفاعل فيه تأثيرات عدة وخاصة الفن العربي، وقد زار تونس والمغرب للتعرف عن كثب على الحضارة الإسلامية، وكشفت مذكراته عن مدى ارتباطه الوثيق بحضارة وسحر الشرق وقصص ألف ليلة، وفي سنة 1928 زار مصر وقام فيها ببعض الدراسات التي كتبها في مجلة (الباو هاوس) بعنوان «تجارب دقيقة في مجال الفن» حيث تحدث عن الضوء والألوان والأحياء القديمة وأثرها في أعماله، كما استفاد من الخط العربي وجمالياته ووظفه في إبداعاته، مثل لوحة "عالم هاربور" التي اعتبرت كأول محاولة أوروبية لتطويع الحرف العربي في الرسم الحديث، مما أثر في الفنان الإسباني خوان ميدو، ويوما يستد، وتوملان وغيرهم. كما استمرت الصور الشعبية المستلهمة من خلال كمية كبيرة من روايات الرحالة والأعمال الأدبية وقصص المغامرات عن النساء والأطفال في ألف ليلة وليلة.[111][112]
التشكيل العربي[عدل]
قدّم الفنان السوري سعد يكن ثلاثين لوحة مستوحاة في الأصل من حكايات «ألف ليلة وليلة»، وتمثل إعادة صياغة لقصص ألف ليلة وتختلف عن مفهوم الاستشراق، حيث أنه لم يستخدم فيها زخرفة أو عناصر تفصيلية، وقد حاول تركيب صياغات جديدة للقصص المهمة وذلك من خلال اللوحات ومن خلال النصوص التي كتبها عن ألف ليلة برؤية مختلفة عن الحدث المباشر للحكايات.
أما الفنان العراقي حسن عيد علوان فتقوم لوحاته المستوحاة من حكايات من ألف ليلة وليلة على الخيال، يستخدم في أعماله اللون الزيتي بشفافية فائقة بطريقة تشبه الألوان المائية، وهذه الألوان لا تغطي كامل المساحة، ويستلهم الفنّان الأجواء البغدادية في زمن الازدهار الحضاري بطريقة مختلفة عن أعمال الفنّانين الآخرين.
كما يعتمد الفنان فؤاد جهاد على الحكايات والأساطير في أعماله، والتكوين في لوحاته أكثر تفصيلاً وتعقيداً، كما يستخدم إضافات زخرفية وتفاصيل تخدم جو اللوحة وهدفها في نقل المشاهد إلى أجواء الحضارات الإسلامية الوسيطة والطرز المعمارية السائدة آنذاك، كما يستخدم رقائق الذهب لتعزيز الشعور بالفخامة. أما الفنان العراقي فاروق حسن فأعاد رسم بعض حكايات شهرزاد، كما برزت وداد الأورفلي بلوحاتها التي تروي قصة ألف ليلة وليلة. بالإضافة إلى عدد من التشكيليين منهم عبد العزيز يوسف، وإبراهيم الدسوقي، وعوض الشيمي، وحياة كنونة، وعدلي رزق الله الذي عمل على مشروع ضخم لرسم قصص ألف ليلة وليلة، وغيرهم من الفنانين.[111][113]

cHAIRMAN's sTATEMENT
sTRATEgY
 e last year has seen Luminar consolidate its position as the leader within
the late night entertainment market and sharpen its focus on operating its
high quality estate of Oceana, Liquid and Lava & Ignite brands. Eight new
branded units were opened during the year.
Significant progress has been made towards achieving our strategy of
creating an optimal business of 110 high quality venues during FY2011.
 e Board is focused on delivering its clear plan and strives to consistently
achieve high returns for shareholders.
Luminar remains extremely cash generative and is in the second year of a
three year programme of enhancing shareholder returns.
 e Group's strategy is clearly focused around three key streams to create
enhanced shareholder value. Our progress towards the completion of this
strategy is measured by KPI targets set in 2006 as outlined below, the
majority of which are either on track or exceeding their targets at this stage.
Maintaining momentum towards the 2011 business structure
Development of our high quality branded destination product: the
prudent re-examination of our capital expenditure plans has resulted
in investment in only the premier locations over the next two years.
Correspondingly, the target has been reset to achieve 74 venues
during FY2011; 
Maintaining and retaining a successful portfolio of unbranded clubs:
target 36 venues during FY2011;
Delivering our development programme with superior returns on
investment.
Improving our operational e ectiveness
Increase admissions by 5.0%;
Increase gross margin by 0.5%; 
Deliver a  6.0m central cost reduction; 
Reduce development cost per square foot to  98 per square foot for
Oceana and  88 per square foot for Liquid.
Improving our financial e ectiveness
Dividend cover of two times;
Share buy-backs of  70.0m over three years, with an ongoing return of
surplus capital to shareholders within the parameters set;
Return on investment of 25.0% post-tax.
 e successful completion of the sale of the Entertainment Division and
some additional non-core clubs in January 2007 was a transformational
deal. In 2007/08 the Group exited a further 11 properties, which generated
proceeds of  7.4m. 
On 19 October 2007 Luminar Group holdings plc replaced Luminar plc as
the listed holding company for the Group and undertook a Scheme of
Arrangement, in order to create su cient distributable reserves to
facilitate its plans for returning cash to shareholders. Following the Scheme
of Arrangement, distributable reserves of over  200.0m were created,
which is after returning  40.8m to shareholders.
On 16 April 2008 the Group exchanged contracts with Cavendish Bars
Limited for the disposal of five subsidiaries which included 26 non-core
units, the majority of which were sub-let or closed.  is e ectively
completed the streamlining of the Group which began two years ago.  e
transaction generated a net loss on disposal of  11.1m (cash cost of  7.3m
including transaction costs), excluding a  4.2m indemnity provision given
in favour of Cavendish Bars Limited, in relation to guarantee liabilities given
on leases for units sold previously. At the year end  3.5m of this indemnity

 e Board has continued with its commitment of returning value to
shareholders.  e cumulative return stands at  82.6m.
More detail on the Group's performance is included within the Business
Review on pages 10 to 23, which follows this statement.
REsulTs
 e results are set out in the financial statements on pages 51 to 54.  ey
are also discussed in the Business Review.
Revenues from continuing operations have increased by 1.9% to  201.3m
(2007:  197.6m).  is was driven principally by growth in sales within the
Dancing Division. Profit before tax from continuing operations pre-
exceptional items has increased by 12.1% to  31.5m (2007:  28.1m). 
Profit before tax from continuing operations post-exceptional items 
has increased by 5.9% to  25.0m (2007:  23.6m). 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations pre-exceptional
items increased by 51.7% to 45.5 pence per share (2007: 30.0 pence
per share).Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations post-
exceptional items increased by 34.1% to 36.2 pence per share (2007: 27.0
pence per share). 
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA )
pre-exceptional items (and pre-loss from associate) from continuing
operations increased by  5.1m to  60.5m (2007:  55.4m).  is gave an
EBITDA per unit from continuing operations of  0.7m (2007:  0.6m).
EBITDA pre-exceptional items from continuing and discontinued
operations was down  10.9m to  59.6m (2007:  70.5m) due to the units
sold as part of the Entertainment Division and other disposals.
cORPORATE sOcIAl REsPONsIBIlITY
 e Group's Corporate Social Responsibility Statement is set out on 
pages 26 to 28. 
 e Group's activities are principally in the late night market for
entertaining, dancing and drinking with the sale of alcoholic drink being
a significant ancillary activity.  e Group places considerable emphasis on
developing, maintaining and monitoring policies and processes designed
to protect the well-being and welfare of customers and employees.  e
Group is also committed to taking into account the interests of the
communities in which it operates.
cuRRENT TRADINg
Our leading market position is set to strengthen as supply in the nightclub
market contracts. Luminar's assets are unrivalled in the late night sector,
well invested and supported by freehold backing.
Like-for-like sales for the first ten weeks of the financial year were up 1.9%
within the Dancing Division and up 7.5% for branded dancing.
Whilst it would be imprudent to suggest that Luminar is totally
impervious to the current economic climate, the majority of our customer
base, being aged 18-24 are non-homeowners and have a spontaneous
attitude to their social behaviour.  is, together with our leading market
position and our deep understanding and experience of the late night
market, gives us confidence that our business is di erentiated from the
drink led high street operators and has a higher degree of in-built
resilience. Accordingly, the Board is confident of delivering further progress
during the current financial year.
DIVIDEND
 e Board is pleased to announce a final dividend of 13.95 pence per
share, giving dividends for the year of 19.32 pence per share (2007:
17.20 pence per share), an increase of 12.3% from the prior year.  is gives
a dividend cover for the year of 2.3 times, which is in line with the policy of
progressively moving to a dividend cover of two times.
suMMARY
 e Group is, by a significant margin, the largest and most experienced
nightclub operator in the UK. It has strong cash flows, outstanding assets
and well-motivated, capable and experienced sta .  e Group's strategy is
being successfully implemented and we are well on track with the
programme to deliver substantial shareholder value through the share
buy-back programme.
 e Group's 2008/09 development programme is progressing well with
four new branded openings and seven refurbishments since the year end. 
Luminar is substantially through its transformation. having achieved clarity
on our strategy, we are well on the way to creating the optimal shape of
the Group. Now our energy is directed at achieving our stated operational
KPIs, delivering e ciency and hence returns.  e focus on the content of
our units will drive growth and maintain our market leadership.  e Board
is confident in the Group's future prospects.

OuR BusINEss AND THE MARKET IN WHIcH WE OPERATE
 e Group operates in the late night market for entertaining, dancing and
drinking, largely through three branded concepts: Oceana, Lava & Ignite
and Liquid.  e Group is the largest operator in its chosen market, with
the competition being largely comprised of much smaller groups and
privately owned clubs. 
 e strategic focus of the Group has sharpened following the disposal of
98 entertainment and other non-core units in January 2007 and 26 units in
April 2008. 
Our core target customers are in the 18-24 age range, which represent
over 80% of our customer base. Fifty-five per cent of this group visit our
nightclubs more than once a month.  e Group continues to monitor
changing trends and tastes, and tailors its branded o erings and marketing
activity to compete e ectively with other operators in the market, and
with the many other activities that compete for the disposable income of
our wider target 18-30 age customers. 
Whilst general consumer confidence in the UK has been falling, largely due
to the di cult economic climate, our target 18-30 age customers remain
less susceptible to economic downturn.  ey live more for today, do not
generally have mortgages, children or regular savings.  ese characteristics
are even stronger amongst our core target 18-24 age customers. 
Rising industry standards and legislative changes are forcing weaker
operators to exit the industry withthe number of nightclubs in the UK
declining over the last two years.  is decline is expected to continue over
the next few years, as can be illustrated by the chart below:
 e Group is well placed to exploit the growing market opportunity for a
genuine high quality clubbing experience and the Group continues to
develop new product sessions to broaden our o ering to existing and
new customers. 
 e legal and regulatory environment in which the Group operates has
been subject to significant change in recent years, notably licensing reform
and smoking bans. New noise regulations came into force in April 2008
and further changes to licensing law in Scotland are also to be introduced.
Licensing reform has enabled the Group to di erentiate itself further from
the high street, drink led establishments and to utilise our skill set in
entertainment and marketing to the full. We have made excellent progress
with our smoking solutions, all units have scenting machines and we have
only seven units where we are presently unable to provide our customers
with an appropriate outside area.

Our mission:
To achieve the highest standard of customer service and

To support our employees and develop their potential, to achieve and

sTRATEgY   MAINTAININg MOMENTuM TOWARDs THE
2011 BusINEss sTRucTuRE
 e Group's strategy has continued to build on its leading position in the
late night market for dancing and drinking, with a more concentrated
focus following the disposal of the 98 entertainment and non-core units in
January 2007, and a further 26 units sold as part of the sale of five
subsidiaries to Cavendish Bars Limited. In addition to a number of branded
units, the Group will retain other properties suitable for branding, plus a
selection of other good quality clubs that achieve high returns.
 e future Luminar nightclub business will be high quality, predominantly
branded, and will provide a product that will di erentiate it from
competitors in the marketplace and allow the business to continue to
prosper through this period of regulatory change. 
In pursuing this strategy the Group has invested in proven branded
concepts, leveraging its substantial operational strengths and experience in
the late night market. 
During 2007/08 the Group invested  46.2m in re-branding, refurbishment
and maintenance capital expenditure, of which 93.9% was on dancing
venues.  ere were eight branded openings   two Oceanas, five Liquids
and one Lava & Ignite, and 15 refurbishments during the year.
Since the year end, there have been four branded openings and seven
refurbishments.

KEY PERFORMANcE INDIcATORs (KPI s)
 e Board reviews and approves the annual budget in the context of the
previously approved strategy. In addition to reviewing performance against
budget on a monthly basis, the Board has established a number of KPIs set
in 2006 for a three year period, to track the delivery of the Group's strategy
and monitor the performance of the business.
Background to the KPIs used in the Group
Admissions and spend per head values drive sales and are thus critical in
monitoring Group revenue.  e gross margin percentage is a primary
indicator of how well sales are being converted into profit. 
Labour cost is a major cost of the business that needs to be tightly
controlled and closely monitored in relation to both the expected and
actual sales. Central costs need to be reduced to increase the e ciency
and profitability of the business and a simple, but substantial cost
reduction target has been set, against which progress is being monitored. 
A reduction in the capital cost of developing new units is a key driver in
delivering target or better than target returns, hence reductions in the cost
per square foot of developments are targeted each year. 
 e Board is committed to returning funds to shareholders and have
targeted a reduction in dividend cover and an absolute target and
timetable for share buy-backs.
 e expected return on investment is critical in evaluating whether
investments should be undertaken.  e same measure is then used as a
means of tracking whether the actual return achieved is as expected when
the investment decision was made.  us the Board has set a hurdle rate
for investment decisions and post-investment reviews.
Actual KPIs showing performance against 2007/08 targets and/or the
previous year are set out below, segmented under headings of operational
and financial e ectiveness. 
IMPROVINg OuR OPERATIONAl EFFEcTIVENEss
Target   increase admissions by 5.0% 
Admissions in total dancing units have increased by 6.4% when compared
to the 2006 target base, on a like-for-like basis. If three new units are
included, the increase is 11.5%.  us the three year target has been
exceeded after two years.
Target   increase gross margin by 0.5%
Gross margin is monitored in its constituent parts and in total.  e main
components are liquor margin and admission charges. Gross margin from
total operations for the year increased by 0.7% to 83.6% of revenue (2007:
82.9%). Gross margin from continuing operations for the year was down
0.6% to 83.7% of revenue (2007: 84.3%). As a consequence of some planned
liquor range changes, cash margin per drink sold in the category has
improved, but the percentage margin on higher retail prices has reduced. 
Target   deliver a  6.0m central cost reduction
Good progress has been made during the year to meet this target. Total
central costs pre-exceptional items have reduced by  5.4m during the year
from the prior year level, of which  3.8m was within continuing
operations.  is brings the total central cost reduction to  8.0m over 
two years, which exceeds the target. 
Target   reduce development cost per square foot to  100 per square
foot for Oceana and  90 per square foot for Liquid
Significant savings have been made against prior year costs but the targets
have not been achieved.  e Oceana brand was close to target at  103, a
substantial reduction on the prior year cost per square foot of  119.  e
cost per square foot for Liquids was  99,  9 higher than the target, but a
reduction on the prior year cost of  103 per square foot. Targets of  98
(Oceana) and  88 (Liquid) have been set for the next financial year.
IMPROVINg OuR FINANcIAl EFFEcTIVENEss
Target   dividend cover of two times
 e total dividends for the year of 19.32 pence per share (2007: 17.20
pence per share) achieve a dividend cover of 2.3 times based on profit
after tax pre-exceptional items.  is is in line with the target of
progressively moving towards a cover of two times, whilst also achieving a

Target   return on investment of 25.0% post-tax
historic investments made in our key brands generated year one returns of
27.9% post-tax (Liquid) and 21.4% post-tax (Oceana). Returns on more
recent investments have been 19.3% post-tax (Liquid) and 12.7% post-tax
(Oceana). Following poor first half year performance, remedial action was
taken and second half year performance was much improved.
 e current focus is on driving down the cost of fitting out new units
through greater standardisation, better planning, better buying and more
cost-e ective specifications for equipment and furnishings.  ese
initiatives together with the increased rigour over capital expenditure are
designed to ensure our investments consistently deliver returns in excess
of our target.
OTHER KPIs
Target for spend per head   none set
Spend per head values and actual trends are monitored weekly by unit on
both a total and like-for-like basis. Total spend per head for the year in
dancing units was  14.09 compared with  13.53 in the previous year, an
increase of 4.1%. 
No target was set for 2008 but there is a target of  14.60 set for branded
dancing in 2009.
Target   reduce labour cost to 27.2% of revenue
 e control of labour costs is critical in the e cient management of our
units, where sta ng levels need to be continually flexed to the right level
for expected sales on a particular night. Labour costs are monitored and
reviewed weekly by unit. Labour cost from total operations (excluding
central employee costs) for the year was down by 0.6% to 27.6% of
revenue (2007: 28.2%) and was down 0.4% compared to the 2006 base
year figure of 28.0%.  e reduction in labour costs is therefore on track.
REgulATORY ENVIRONMENT 
Our experience to date of the smoking ban indicates only a marginal
impact on our dancing units. Our branded estate has had priority on the
provision of smoking areas and has thus coped well with the change in
legislation.  e unbranded units have su ered more from the ban but
appropriate smoking areas are now completed or in progress for all but
seven of our units where the solution is still being developed. Scenting
machines have been rolled out across the estate. Greater labour costs have
been incurred in monitoring the additional areas, but units are now a lot
easier to clean following the ban and the introduction of polycarbonate as
an alternative to glassware. 
 e changes to the licensing regime have intensified the competitive
pressure on the late night market, specifically in the high street sector. 
 e Group is facing additional competition but its core dancing business,
especially the branded units, continue to perform strongly. We will plan
for and monitor compliance with further changes to licensing law 
in Scotland. 
Since we are a  people' business, we are particularly conscious of changes
in employment law and regulation. We constantly review our employment
policies in light of any such legislative or regulatory changes. For example,
we prepared fully for the new noise regulations that came into force on
6 April 2008 and will monitor our compliance going forward.

The refurbishment cost  5m and transformed the
42,000 square foot venue into a 2,500 capacity
Oceana.
Trading throughout the week, Brighton offers
something for everyone: from students to disco divas
through to serious clubbers. The club also boasts
fantastic VIP suites that are available for private hire

LEADER IN LATE NIGhT ENTERTAINMENT
RIsKs AND uNcERTAINTIEs
 e principal risks and uncertainties that could a ect the Group's business
are summarised below:
Risks
Internal risks
Covenant compliance
Management monitor and review actual and projected covenant
compliance on a monthly basis.  e Group has been and continues to be
in full compliance with its banking covenants. 
High proportion of fixed overheads and variable revenues
A significant proportion of the Group's cost base remains constant
notwithstanding changes to the level of revenues; therefore, any significant
changes in the level of the Group's revenues could significantly a ect the
level of earnings and cash flows.
Significant progress has been made in simplifying and reducing the head
o ce fixed cost base and this remains an area of focus going forward.
Failure to ensure brands evolve in relation to changes in consumer taste
 e market in which the Group operates is subject to changes in fashions
and trends, and the Group is exposed to the risk that its innovations in
venue format and content do not keep up with changes in consumer
tastes.  e Group continues to closely monitor changes in the
marketplace and adapts its o ering to protect and secure its revenue.
Major fire
 e business has su ered from three major fires since 2000, resulting in the
destruction and closure of the units concerned. Fire prevention and fire
safety are taken very seriously in sta  training and internal health and
safety reviews. Additionally, insurance cover has been improved through a
substantial reduction in the excess payable by the Group on any one
incident, thus reducing the financial risk posed by any major fires that
might be su ered in the future.
Health and safety
health and safety is taken very seriously by the Group as detailed in the
Corporate Social Responsibility statement.  e risk of non-compliance
with health and safety legislation is minimised through comprehensive
training and an active in-house team who regularly carry out health and
safety audits, and review and develop policies and procedures to maintain
standards. Furthermore, the Group carries substantial public and
employer's liability insurance cover, in order to minimise the financial
impact of any claim that might arise as a consequence of a failure in health
and safety regulatory compliance.
Failure of internal control regarding frauds and thefts
 e Group is vulnerable to the conventional financial threats faced by 
all businesses. During the year 2006/07 the finance department was
restructured and relocated from Preston to the Milton Keynes head o ce.
 is has resulted in the recruitment of a new qualified and experienced
management team who continue to review, challenge and improve many
processes and controls.  is process is backed up by an increased
emphasis on internal audit covering both head o ce
administration/accounting and the operating units.
External risks
High street overcapacity
 is is not a significant risk for the Group as our units are predominately
branded destination dancing units generally located away from the high
rents and overcapacity associated with trading on the high street. 
Reversion of leases and rent guarantees
In connection with the sale of the Entertainment Division and the sale or
sub-let of other units, there is a risk that the Group could become liable
for rent, rates, service and insurance payments on former units. Current
planning assumes no additional liabilities beyond the known liabilities for
which provision has already been made. Following the disposal of the five
subsidiaries to Cavendish Bars Limited, any exposure to the reversion of
leases and rent guarantees will be limited under the terms of the
indemnity to  3.5m.
Interest rate movements
Interest rate risk is being predominately managed through swapping
between floating rate debt and fixed rate debt.  is has being achieved
through the purchase of a  50.0m five year fixed rate swap, a  40.0m seven
year fixed rate swap and a  50.0m cap and collar swap. 
Loss of licences 
 e Group has a dedicated and experienced central team to monitor 
all licensing related matters, working closely with the operations
management team, local licensing authorities and local police.  is is
backed up with centralised incident reporting and follow-up, including
liaison with licensing authorities for early warning of potential issues. 
Every e ort is made to ensure that managers and supervisors are fully
conversant with current licensing legislation and their responsibilities
under it.

Uncertainties
Economic downturn
 e Group is competing for a share of the disposable income of its target
customers so revenue could be vulnerable to the impact of any economic
downturn. Some leisure businesses and high-street retailers are seeing
downturns in business due to reduced consumer spending. however,
rising spend per head and improving occupancy rates in many of our units
indicate that the business is better placed than other businesses to cope
with a downturn.  e quality of our units and the financial strength of the
Group will continue to give the business an edge over other late night
operators, some of whom will not survive in more di cult trading
conditions. Current planning assumes no significant impact on the
business of a general downturn in the economy. 
Regulatory changes
 e consequences of changes in legislation on licensing and smoking 
are now clearer and the business model has been adapted to take into
account the impact of both.  is has included changes in opening 
hours, changes to our promotional activity and the creation of outdoor
smoking areas.
Seasonality and weather
 e number of admissions in the Group's venues is considerably increased
during holiday periods, especially Christmas and New Year, and over bank
holiday periods. Similarly the admissions and revenue levels are generally
lower in the early months of the calendar year and over the summer,
compared to during the autumn and spring periods.  e Group's revenues
can also be adversely impacted by extremes of weather conditions, which
could deter customers from visiting the Group's venues. Current planning
assumes average seasonal weather conditions.
Fluctuations in the commercial property market
At the year end the Group held 96 of its units under short leaseholds
(including units in development and sub-let units), which are subject to
regular rent reviews.  ese rent reviews could either significantly increase
or decrease the level of the Group's fixed cost base, which could a ect the
economic viability of any of the Group's units.
At the year end the Group held 25 freehold units and 14 long leaseholds;
therefore, any changes to the UK property market could lead to changes
in the value of the Group's property portfolio. Current planning assumes
no significant change in the commercial property market.
Terrorism
In common with many businesses, the Group's revenues are vulnerable to
disruption from acts of terrorism. Current planning assumes no change in
the existing level of threat.

Sales from continuing operations were up  3.7m (1.9%) to  201.3m (2007:
 197.6m). Continuing like-for-like sales for the Dancing Division were up
1.6%, with continuing branded like-for-like sales up 4.8%.
Gross margin from total operations for the year increased by 0.7% to 83.6%
of revenue (2007: 82.9%). Gross margin from continuing operations has
weakened by 60 basis points to 83.7% (2007: 84.3%). As a consequence of
some planned liquor range changes, cash margin per drink sold in the
category has improved but the percentage margin on higher retail prices
has reduced. 
EBITDA pre-exceptional items (and pre-loss from the associate) from
continuing operations has increased by  5.1m to  60.5m (2007:  55.4m).
 is gave an EBITDA per unit from continuing operations of  0.7m (2007:
 0.6m). EBITDA from continuing and discontinued operations pre-
exceptional items (and pre-loss from the associate) was down  10.9m to
 59.6m (2007:  70.5m).  is decrease was due to the units sold as part of
the Entertainment Division and other disposals.
Total profit before tax pre-exceptional items has reduced to  30.1m (2007:
 41.5m) due to the sale of the Entertainment Division and other disposals.
Profit before tax from continuing operations pre-exceptional items has
increased by  3.4m to  31.5m (2007:  28.1m), and the loss before tax from
discontinued operations pre-exceptional items was  1.4m (2007:  13.4m
profit).  e increase from continuing operations was due to a  3.8m
reduction in central costs, a  2.1m reduction in net finance costs, o set by
a  2.3m increase in the loss from the associate and a  0.2m reduction in
profit from operations pre-exceptional items. Net finance costs have
reduced due to a lower weighted average net debt level, despite an
increase in the interest rate payable. Diluted earnings per share from
continuing operations pre-exceptional items was up 51.7% to 45.5 pence
per share (2007: 30.0 pence per share).
Profit before tax from continuing operations post-exceptional items was

 e Group has continued to transform its underlying business to a more focused branded destination dancing business.  ere were eight branded
openings during the year, bringing the branded portfolio at the year end to ten Oceanas, seven Lava & Ignites, 33 Liquids and two Life clubs. 
Continuing sales were driven by increases from the Dancing Division. Performance was particularly strong in the first half, with growth of 7.9% for the year.
Sales in the branded dancing units increased by 12.8% to  125.1m (2007:  110.9m), with a like-for-like sales increase of 4.8%. Like-for-like sales for the
Oceana and Liquid brands were up 5.2% and 7.6% respectively. Like-for-like sales for the Lava & Ignite brand were down 1.4% for the year.

the unbranded units reduced to 26.9% of revenue (2007: 30.1%). 
Operating costs have increased as a result of higher fixed costs and carrying the closure costs of certain units whilst undergoing re-branding. however,

BusINEss REVIEW ConTInuED
 e non-core units reported within continuing operations include the six
units previously reported within the Entertainment Division, and three
closed non-core units, which did not meet the criteria for presentation as
held for sale at the year end, and therefore have been classified within
continuing operations.  is Division also includes units which are closed
for development until the unit has re-opened, at which point the unit is
transferred into dancing.
Sales for the Non-core Division were down 26.1% to  26.1m (2007:
 35.3m), of which units in development have contributed to a 35.7%
reduction in sales to  16.2m (2007:  25.2m). Profit from operations has
reduced to  4.2m (2007:  7.4m), of which units in development have
contributed to a  3.3m reduction in profit from operations to  1.4m (2007:
 4.7m).  is reduction can be explained by an increase in fixed property
costs and employee costs, as a percentage of revenue.
Central costs
Central costs comprise the head o ce and administrative functions, area
and divisional management costs, central depreciation and information
technology costs for the Group. 
During the year the Group has made excellent progress in reducing the
corporate cost base. Central costs from continuing operations reported
within profit/(loss) from operations pre-exceptional items have reduced by
 3.8mto  13.4m (2007:  17.2m). 
Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations comprise the 26 units included in the Cavendish
Bars Limited transaction, units sold as part of the Entertainment Division
and non-core clubs disposal, and other units, which are either held for sale
or have been disposed of during the year or prior year. Non-core units yet
to be marketed for sale are presented within continuing operations, since
although these units form part of the Group's disposal strategy, these units
do not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations under
IFRS 5, non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations. 
 e number of units comprising discontinued operations totals 148, of
which nine relate to disposals in the current year and 110 relate to prior
year disposals.  e remaining 29 units relate to other trading or closed
non-core operations held for sale. 
Of the nine single site units disposed of in the current year within
discontinued operations, six related to unit sales with net proceeds of
 6.5m, one was a lease surrender for a payment of  0.2m, one was a lease
assignment and one was a lease expiry.
Sales relating to discontinued operations total  5.3m (2007:  102.8m), with
a loss before tax pre-exceptional items of  1.4m (2007:  13.4m profit).  e
significant decrease in sales and profitability was mainly due to the large
number of prior year disposals.
cAPITAl EXPENDITuRE 
Cash outflows relating to capital expenditure, including intangible assets, have reduced to  48.9m (2007:  52.9m), and are analysed between the 
following components:

(2007:  13.5m) relating to discontinued operations. 
 e exceptional charges primarily relate to the disposal of five of the
Group's subsidiaries to Cavendish Bars Limited.  is transaction generated
a loss of  11.1m in the current year. As part of the transaction, the Group
also agreed to enter into indemnities capped at  4.2m in favour of
Cavendish Bars Limited in relation to guarantee liabilities given on leases
for units sold previously. At the year end  3.5m of this indemnity was
provided for, being the amount relating to property costs which the Group
considers are likely to be called upon by Cavendish Bars Limited.
FINANcIAl POsITION
Balance sheet 
 e net assets of the Group have reduced to  307.9m (2007:  378.8m),
predominately due to an increase in the level of the Group's borrowings to
fund the return of capital under the Scheme of Arrangement and share
buy-backs. 
property, plant and equipment
During the year, the net book value of property, plant and equipment
increased by  14.2m to  314.6m (2007:  300.4m).  e movement was
attributed to capital expenditure of  48.3m (2007:  54.6m), disposals of
 1.0m (2007:  105.8m), depreciation charges of  21.8m (2007:  21.2m) and
impairment charges of  3.9m (2007:  5.6m), together with the
reclassification of properties to assets held for sale of  7.4m (2007:  4.7m).
 is is illustrated below:
Property, plant and equipment includes  51.1m (2007:  55.2m) relating to
freehold land and buildings. A further  5.8m (2007:  9.2m) relating to
freehold properties is reported within assets held for sale.

BusINEss REVIEW ConTInuED
An external valuation of the Group's freehold and long leasehold
properties was undertaken at the year end, on a consistent basis as that
undertaken at the prior year end.  is revealed a value of  180.0m
(2007:  200.0m), which is in excess of their book value.
Trade and other receivables
Total trade and other receivables have increased by  1.9m to  28.7m 
(2007:  26.8m).  1.6m of this increase relates to interest receivable on the
loan note with  e 3D Entertainment Group Limited.  is brings the loan
note receivable from  e 3D Entertainment Group Limited to  21.1m
(2007:  19.5m).
Investment in associate held for sale
As part of the disposal of the Entertainment Division in the prior year to
 e 3D Entertainment Group Limited, the Group acquired a 49% stake in
 e 3D Entertainment Group Limited, initially valued at  30.6m.  e
Group has recognised its share of the post-tax loss of the associate
totalling  2.6m (2007:  0.3m) relating to the period until the investment
was classified as held for sale from 18 September 2007.  e investment is
therefore no longer equity accounted for, but is held at the lower of
adjusted cost (cost adjusted for changes in the net assets of the associate)
and fair values less cost to sell.
Cash flow 
 e Group's continuing operations contributed pre-exceptional cash flows
from operations of  54.1m (2007:  50.7m), up  3.4m from the prior year. 
Total cash flows from operating activities were down  10.4m to  40.4m
(2007:  50.8m).  is was predominately due to a  14.5m reduction in net
cash flows from operating activities from discontinued operations, due to
the large number of disposals during the prior year. A reconciliation of
total cash flows from operating activities is included below:
 ere has been a  1.1m increase in the exceptional cash flows from
continuing operations due to higher cash exceptional items relating to
costs of reorganisation and rationalisation in the current year.
 e Group has reduced its net cash inflow on investing activities by
 75.3m to a  43.4m outflow (2007:  31.9m inflow), as a result of the net
proceeds of  74.0m received in the prior year on the disposal of the
Entertainment Division. 
Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets during the year has led to a cash outflow of  46.2m (2007:  52.9m).
During the year  7.4m (2007:  12.1m) was received in relation to the
disposal of 11 properties (of which one related to a former head o ce
lease expiry and one related to a lodging house in Jersey).  is resulted in a
 nil profit on sale post-transaction costs. A further  0.4m was received on
the disposal of motor vehicles, which generated a  0.2m profit on disposal.
During the year two units were acquired for a total consideration of  2.7m.
One of these units is currently in development to become a Liquid, and
the other unit is being traded as an unbranded dancing unit.
 e costs associated with the disposal of a business totalling  2.4m relate
to costs accrued in 2006/07 for the sale of the Entertainment Division
which were paid in the current year.
Finance income for the year was  0.3m,  1.0m lower than in the prior year
(2007:  1.3m), as a result of less monies being placed on short-term deposit.
Cash outflows from financing activities have reduced to  4.6m outflow
(2007:  140.1m outflow), predominately comprising the net receipt of
 71.2m (2007:  106.7m repayment) in relation to the bank loan,  20.4m
(2007:  21.6m) for the repurchase of shares including transaction costs (of
which  1.5m relates to prior year commitments),  40.8m (2007:  nil) for
the return of capital from the Scheme of Arrangement and  11.8m (2007:
 11.4m) to fund the payment of the ordinary dividends. 
Net debt
 e level of net debt has increased by  78.4m to  145.8m (2007:  67.4m).
 e significant elements of the increase in net debt over the year are
outlined below.
During the year the Group negotiated new banking facilities critically
ahead of the worsening debt market conditions following the  credit
crunch'. Correspondingly, the Group will not need to refinance in the
current challenging and costly debt environment.  e previous bank loan
of  90.0m was repaid in August 2007 and a new facility for  175.0m

(excluding a  5.0m overdraft facility) was taken out. At the year end
 145.0m of the facility was drawn down.  140.0m of this has been hedged
through a number of hedging instruments. 
Cash and cash equivalents at the year end totalled  7.1m (2007:  14.7m). 
 e interest cover ratio for the year, pre-exceptional items from continuing
operations, has increased to 7.8 (2007: 5.2).  e weighted average net debt
for the year was lower than in the prior year, but the weighted average
interest rate was higher. Net borrowings to EBITDA pre-exceptional items
at the year end were 2.4 times (2007: 0.96 times). Fixed charge cover for the
year was 2.9 (2007: 2.4). Gearing, measured as a percentage of shareholders'
funds, was 47.4% at the year end (2007: 17.8%). 
cAPITAl sTRucTuRE AND sHAREHOlDER RETuRN 
Financing structure
 e Group primarily funds its activities through a revolving five year,
syndicated  175.0m (2007:  190.0m) facility, secured by a floating charge
over all the assets of the Group. At the year end the Group has drawn
down  145.0m (2007:  73.3m) of this facility, with floating facilities of
 30.0m (2007:  116.7m) undrawn at the year end.  e Group also has an
overdraft facility of  5.0m (2007:  5.0m).
Details of the Group's contingent liabilities and capital commitments are
outlined in notes 33 and 34 to the financial statements, and the Group's

Market capitalisation
At the year end the Group had 60.9m (2007: 69.8m) ordinary shares in
issue, and a market capitalisation at the year end of  224.4m (2007:
 523.7m). During the course of the year, the Group's market capitalisation
ranged from  188.6m to  574.1m. 
Dividends and capital structure
 e Board has proposed a 13.2% increase in the final dividend to
13.95 pence per share (2007: 12.32 pence per share).  e increase in the
level of the dividend reflects the Group's confidence in the re-branding
strategy, whilst retaining adequate funds for future capital investment,
acknowledging the pressures the business faces through the current
trading environment and period of significant regulatory change.  e
future dividend policy will be tightened to provide a future dividend cover
of two times.  e current year dividend provides a cover of 2.3 times.
During the year the Group has returned  18.8m (2007:  23.0m) to
shareholders in the form of share buy-backs and  40.8m as part of the
Scheme of Arrangement. 
FINANcIAl RIsK MANAgEMENT 
Taxation
 e current approach of the UK tax authorities means that as a large
corporate entity we are subject to regular tax audits, which by their very
nature are often complex and take many years to complete. We draw a
distinction between tax planning for non-commercial reasons, and
optimising the tax treatment of commercial transactions, and we only
enter into tax planning in respect of the latter.
Funding and liquidity
 e Group's cash and debt balances are managed centrally. Liquidity risk is
managed through an assessment of short, medium and long-term cash
flow forecasts to ensure the adequacy of debt facilities. 
 e Group has positive cash flows from operating activities, and the cash
balances and undrawn funding are adequate to finance the ongoing
working capital, share buy-backs and capital investment requirements of
the Group's operations.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is being predominately managed through swapping
between floating rate debt and fixed rate debt.  is has been achieved
through the purchase of a  50.0m five year fixed rate swap, a  40.0m
seven year fixed rate swap and a  50.0m cap and collar swap. At the
year end  145.0m of the bank facility was drawn down, of which  140.0m
was hedged.
Currency risk
 e Group operates predominately within the UK and substantially all
transactions are denominated in sterling; therefore, the Group does not
su er from a significant concentration of currency risk.
Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and
cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks
and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to receivables
principally recognised on sales of property assets and on income received
from sub-lets.  e Group does not have a significant concentration of
credit risk, and the majority of the Group's revenues are cash based.
A vendor loan note of  19.3m (plus accrued interest totalling  1.8m) with
 e 3D Entertainment Group Limited is receivable on the earlier of a
subsequent sale of the business, refinancing or 2013. At the year end, the
recoverability of the loan is not perceived to be a high credit risk.
Pensions
 e Group contributes to a defined contribution pension scheme for
qualifying employees.  e Group has no exposure to defined benefit
pension schemes.
FORWARD-lOOKINg sTATEMENTs
Certain statements in this consolidated financial information for the year

AnSWER: We have honed down our asset base from over 250 disparate
venues to a highly focused business of 90 high quality, more profitable
units.
Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) has
increased on a per unit basis by over 15% in the last 12 months.
We will continue to role out our successful brand templates to the rest of
our estate in order to reach our targeted structure during FY2011.
QuESTIon: DOEs THE gROuP HAVE ANY PlANs TO

REgARD TO cORPORATE sOcIAl REsPONsIBIlITY ( csR') AND
ENVIRONMENTAl IssuEs?
AnSWER: We have always treated CSR issues as a key element of our
operational programme. For example, we have led our industry in the
adoption of polycarbonates as an alternative to glassware and this has
proved safer for both our customers and employees. Other initiatives

website. 
QuESTIon: HOW HAs THE sMOKINg BAN AFFEcTED
THE BusINEss?
AnSWER: Since the smoking ban was introduced there has been a
marginal impact on the overall level of sales.  e impact has been greater
in units which do not have the internally accessed outdoor smoking
terraces. however, as stated elsewhere in this report, all but seven of our
venues have this solution now and customer feedback has been positive.
Over the medium term we expect the quality of the experience to
improve for all our customers whether they wish to smoke or not.
QuESTIon: DOEs THE cOMPANY HAVE PlANs FOR

the best interests of our shareholders.
QuESTIon: HOW WEll PlAcED Is THE BusINEss TO DEAl

AnSWER: As a business operating in the UK we are clearly not immune
to the general economic climate. however, any impact is likely to be
significantly mitigated due to the fairly unique profile of our customers,
who are not generally encumbered by mortgages and household bills.

cORPORATE sOcIAl REsPONsIBIlITY
As a listed business which is also the leader in its field, we are fully aware of
the e ect our operations may have on the communities in which we
operate and our responsibilities in this regard. 
Accordingly, we recognise our responsibilities towards our customers,
employees, investors and other stakeholders and appreciate the benefits 
of operating in an ethical and responsible way. 
 is year sees Luminar celebrate its 20th birthday and ever since it was
formed, we have faced challenges from economic, social and legislative
changes. Even though these factors may have caused the behaviour of our
customers to change, we have seen each change as a new opportunity for
our business.  anks to the e orts of our Directors and employees, who are
the most experienced operational management in our industry, we have
been able to maintain our position as the leading operator in our sector.
REsPONsIBlE RETAIlINg
Luminar continues to apply the principles which were set out in the 
five point plan (the Plan ) that was developed in preparation for the
implementation of the Licensing Act 2003.  e Plan was communicated to
every local authority and police force in the areas in which we operate and
with their help we have developed the Plan even further.  e Plan outlines
the following areas and enables us to e ectively manage the cumulative
e ect of licensed venues in towns where we trade:
dispersal policies;
minimum pricing conditions;
capacity conditions;
risk assessment; and 
dancing provision and policies.
AlcOHOl MIsusE AND  BINgE DRINKINg' 
Alcohol misuse and binge drinking are two issues which a ect society and
may compromise the well-being of our customers. Since our employees
are well positioned to influence the attitudes and behaviours of customers,
we train them to identify those customers who they consider might
exceed a safe and responsible intake of alcohol.
uNDER-AgE DRINKINg 
Under-age drinking regrettably remains a major issue within our society
and we continually take steps to prevent under-age persons entering our
premises.  e  Challenge 21' scheme was introduced specifically to address
this problem and has proved extremely e ective.  is scheme requires that
if any of our employees or door security teams think they might be dealing
with a customer who is under 21, they simply ask that customer to
produce identification to prove their age.  e onus is placed on the
customer to prove that they are 18 or over and are old enough to be in
that venue. If the identification presented appears fake or has been
tampered with, the individual presenting it will be refused entry and
excluded from the venue. In certain cases the police may be called and the
person issued with an  on the spot' fine, dependent on local agreements
with the authorities.
FuTuRE cluBBINg   uKcluB culTuRE (uKcc )
UKCC is Luminar's most successful  event' brand. It is an inspirational and
credible clubbing experience for teenagers aged 13 to 17. In order to
comply with the Licensing Objective of  protecting children from harm', we
work with local Police and Licensing Authorities to ensure a safe
environment. UKCC operates within a well-established framework of strict
policies and procedures.  ese include policies on Admissions, Child
Protection and General Operations. In addition to these policies, all
employees at our UKCC events are required to conduct themselves in
accordance with an internal code of conduct. 
UKCC customers (and their parents or guardians) are also encouraged to
access our UKCC website: www.ukclubculture.com.  is provides UKCC
related information, including details of events and the policies referred to
previously, as well as information for parents and other services such as a
secure online ticket purchase facility, details of artists and entertainment as
well as addresses and maps for each venue.
sEcuRITY
We employ the services of specialised security contractors whose sta 
endeavour to ensure the welfare of customers both outside and inside the
venue.  e sta  are trained to be pro-active in recognising potential
incidents, identifying vulnerable individuals and providing assistance 
where necessary. 
Door supervisors are also responsible for:
preventing weapons or illegal substances being taken into our venues;
ensuring e ective queue management; and 
the controlled dispersal of customers at the end of an evening's
trading. 
 ese measures are designed to control behaviour, minimise disruption to
residents and limit any negative impact on surrounding communities.
Door supervisors are licensed by their industry body, the Security Industry
Authority (SIA ), in accordance with the terms of the Private Security
Industry Act 2001. In addition, door supervisors are required to operate to
the British Standard BS7960. We have adopted the requirements set out in
these two regulatory standards and use them as the basis for the service
levels and protocols for the management of incidents which we require the
door stewarding companies to deliver at our venues. We have now operated
these arrangements for a year and following a review, have developed those
standards further to improve security control in our venues.
Establishing e ective contracts with the door supervising companies has
created stronger partnerships with each of them and continues our aim of
driving forward the highest standards of excellence in the security industry.
 is process will continue throughout 2008 and there will be regular
meetings to discuss current security and operational issues a ecting 
our premises.
Although training of door stewards is crucial to their success, so too is the
equipment available to them. We invest in our security systems and
continually strive to ensure that we use the latest and the most reliable
technology available. For example, we are currently introducing hand-worn
metal detectors across our entire estate.  ese detectors enhance the
safety of the user and increase incidents of detection. In addition, our
teams are supported by the use of CCTV cameras and any venue that
undergoes a refurbishment automatically receives an upgrade to its 
CCTV system.

Luminar Group Holdings plc Stock Code: LMR 27
LEADER IN LATE NIGhT ENTERTAINMENT
To ensure the technology in our venues is the latest available, we have
produced a Minimum Specification Document for our CCTV suppliers.
 is will maintain high standards and consistency of equipment across our
estate.  is approach has proved so successful that several licensing
authorities are using this template as an operating model for other venues
(even those run by our competitors).
HEAlTH AND sAFETY
 e health and safety of our customers, employees, contractors and local
communities is critical to our success. Our health and Safety team
continues to promote high standards by carrying out regular audits and
ongoing reviews of policies and procedures.
We continue to use the  Lite Patrol' system in our venues to monitor
potential risks from spillages and breakages etc.  is system identifies
hazards and prompts employees to take the appropriate remedial action. 
We also continue to promote our unique policy called  Dancesafe'.  is
policy establishes the overall management of safety within our venues and
provides advice to customers on issues such as unlicensed taxis and
possible spiking of drinks.
In 2007 we commenced a strategy of replacing glass with polycarbonate
plastic in all of our venues.  is has nearly concluded and almost 100% of
our venues now use polycarbonates. In our CSR report for 2006/07 we
noted that this had led to a significant reduction in the number of
incidents and injuries involving broken glass and early data shows that
recorded incidents for January 2008 were reduced by 43% when compared
with incidents in January 2007.
Replacement of glass with polycarbonate plastics has also lessened the
burden previously placed on the Emergency Services.
Following the positive feedback from this project, we are now 
continuing to explore our glass replacement options within our bottled
beverage range. We are also developing cleaning products to prolong the
life of the polycarbonates and expanding the recycling programmes for
these products.
NOIsE AT WORK 
In preparation for the new Noise at Work Regulations which took e ect in
the entertainment industry on 6 April 2008 we have successfully trained all
employees on the impact of this legislation. Personal Protective Equipment
in the form of ear plugs has been provided for all employees and we are
looking to implement a health surveillance programme to assess and
monitor the a ect of noise on our employees.
sMOKINg BAN
 e national smoking ban was brought into force in England on 1 July 2007
and we used our experiences in Scotland and Wales to prepare well for this
new legislation. As a result we have successfully installed smoking terraces
across the vast majority of our estate and only seven units still require a
solution to the smoking ban.
DEVElOPMENT
With the new building regulations now firmly in place, our property and
development team has evaluated the implications for new developments
and has introduced new initiatives on energy usage and thermal e ciency.
We also continue to emphasise the use of building materials which are
man-made or can be sourced from renewable resources.
We have also taken advantage of improvements in technology and our
lighting installations now include a high percentage of LED lighting with
the remaining areas being fitted with low energy fittings. Our heating and
ventilation systems are now being installed with improved controls which
will, in turn, improve the overall e ciency of our venues. 
OuR PEOPlE
To help ensure that our employees feel appreciated and motivated we
support them in all aspects of training and development. We have
launched the Crew Development Programme which provides employees
with the opportunity to embark on a rewarding and exciting career which
may lead into management roles.
 e Foundation Degree in Leadership & Management (late night
entertainment), validated by Nottingham Trent University, is in its second
year and allows employees to follow their career path and also to gain a
highly regarded academic qualification which is recognised throughout 
the world. 
We have introduced four key values that encapsulate the work
environment we wish to achieve. 
 ese values involve being:
Passionate;
Participative;
Professional; and 
Principled.
We encourage our employees to adopt those principles throughout their
working life with Luminar.
We also link these values into our one system  operations approach which
focuses on achieving high standards in the following four areas:
Session excellence;
People excellence;
Financial excellence; and
Customer excellence.
We have established additional Key Performance Indicators (KPIs ) in each
of these areas.  ese are:
sales growth;
team turnover;
operational profit versus target; and 
mystery customer data
respectively, and it is now easy to identify how we have performed against
these specific criteria.

cORPORATE sOcIAl REsPONsIBIlITY ConTInuED
We recognise that to be successful our business requires good management
and leadership at all levels. To ensure this continues we have invested in a
cultural change programme facilitated by the world renowned training
company Lane 4.  is was delivered to all operational managers and those
from the Unit Support Centre (USC ).  e programme, which was
designed to develop better leadership behaviours and coaching skills, was
well received and has benefited the business already.
We also understand that for these initiatives to be successful, we need to
ensure that they are communicated clearly throughout the business. We
have a variety of internal publications for the benefit of our employees
including our quarterly internal magazine known as  e-luminate' and our
monthly newsletter called  Right here Right Now'. In addition, once a
month the Chief Executive, Stephen  omas, provides an update to the
business on current trading figures, the areas on which we are currently
focused and celebrate the success of our employees through the  Star
Performers Scheme'.  is presentation is known as  Tuesday Newsday' and
forms a link between the USC employees and the operations side of the
business, keeping all parties updated on the strategy and performance of
the Group. In addition, Employee Forums are used as the mechanism by
which to communicate to our employees any legal and regulatory matters
that might a ect them, and annual opinion surveys provide valuable
feedback in terms of how we are performing.
EcHO TRusT cHARITY
During the year a total of  238,602 (2007:  173,575) was donated by our
customers and sta  to Luminar's established charity, the EChO Trust.  is
money was raised from charity collections within venues and donations
made at Company organised events. 
 e main fund-raising event of the year was the  Give a Kid a Quid'
campaign which encouraged customers to simply donate  1.  is was
supported by Dancing on Ice winner, Kyran Bracken, along with his show
partner, professional skater, Melanie Lambert, and raised a staggering
 118,364 during a two week period from 20 December 2007 to
2 January 2008. 
Fund-raising campaigns planned for 2008 include two  Give a Kid a Quid'
programmes at Easter and Christmas as well as a campaign for the August
Bank holiday.
THE ENVIRONMENT
Luminar strives to reduce any adverse impact that our activities may have
on the environment. We have taken various measures to achieve this and
have set ourselves stretching targets to ensure that we pro-actively
monitor, manage and minimise such e ects.
Our achievements for the year are as follows:
Approximately 92% of the waste produced by Luminar is glass. 9,071
tonnes of waste were produced, of which 8,316 tonnes of glass were
diverted away from landfill to be recycled;
In the year 2007/08, 755 tonnes of card, plastic and paper were
collected for recycling, an increase of 39% on the previous year;
 e Group used 20.5m kWh (2007: 36.9m kWh) of gas and 86.8m kWh
(2007: 71.1m kWh) of electricity, 53.3m kWh (2007: 34.3 kWh) of which
were from cleaner sources, provided by highly e cient combined heat
and power plants;
We reduced our fleet from 133 to 80 vehicles.  roughout the year our
consumption of unleaded petrol was reduced by 60% and now only
8% of our vehicles require unleaded fuel; and
We are currently trialling the use of hybrid vehicles to further reduce
our emissions.
We will continue to utilise the services of an independent contractor to
remove all expired electrical goods to ensure the suitable disposal and
comprehensive recycling of each. We are also researching the possibility of
recycling aluminium cans and plastic and exploring storage solutions to
make such recycling viable.
Our water consumption has been monitored and reviewed by an external
water engineer continuously for the last nine years.  is has resulted in us
minimising unnecessary water wastage and has provided us with detailed
knowledge of the water systems on sites and consumption. We continue to
install urinal flushing sensors, which save water, in recently developed units.
ENERgY MANAgEMENT
Following our investment in the installation of  smart' electricity meters in
1999 we can measure the smallest usages in our venues. half-hourly
consumption data is remotely collected from the meters every night and
used to identify opportunities to reduce consumption and subsequently
ensure our sites continue to operate at the optimum level. Moreover, we
can view consumption the next day via a web portal. 
We will soon have the same visibility for our gas supplies as remote half-
hourly metering will be installed by the end of May 2008.
Luminar operates an Energy Management Programme which targets units
in the estate to reduce their consumption of energy, particularly during
their non-trading hours.  is is assisted by the use of an external Energy
Manager who advises individual sites on how e ectively they are operating
against agreed targets.  is hands-on approach and the graphical
presentation of the results to each site and to the Operational
Management Team has proved very e ective. To date, the programme has
reduced consumption by 15% per unit on average.
 is programme is still in the early stages and is currently operational in 
43 of 61 units throughout the southern region. An early indicative figure
for CO2 reduction in 2008 is 1.46m kg. We would hope to increase these
figures significantly on a full roll-out across the estate.
suPPlIERs AND cONTRAcTORs
Our purchasing team sets objectives and targets to ensure that we can
continually meet high standards.  ese objectives include:
a structured project plan, targeting the high spend areas;
improved Supplier Assessment and Contract Monitoring Procedures;
auditable files which easily map the processes we conduct; and
revision of the Luminar Purchasing Policy.
 e purchasing team also endeavours to develop mutually beneficial, long-
term relationships with reliable suppliers for goods and services who satisfy
our requirements in a timely, e cient and cost-e ective manner. We aim
to maintain open and collaborative relationships with suppliers and
potential suppliers. To do this we will endeavour to practise the highest
standards of honesty, integrity, impartiality and objectivity.
In dealing with suppliers we seek to be fair, e cient, professional,
competent and courteous. In return, we expect them to observe similar
standards. We expect our suppliers to apply a high ethical approach in
their dealings with the Group and their own suppliers.
We place a high priority on our environmental strategy and expect our
suppliers to do the same. how they approach these issues is becoming an
increasingly significant factor in the engagement of new suppliers. We aim
to establish targets with our suppliers, which reflect our views on green
issues and our commitment to growing our business in an environmentally
friendly manner.

APPlIcATION OF PRINcIPlEs
 is statement describes how the Group applies the principles contained
within the 2006 FRC Combined Code (the Code ) appended to the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
 e Board considers that it has complied with the Code throughout the
year.  e Board continues to be pro-active in reviewing its practices and
e ectiveness.
DIREcTORs
At 28 February 2008, the Board consisted of the Chairman, four Non-
Executive Directors and two Executive Directors.  e Chairman of the
Board is Alan Jackson who joined the Board on 5 December 2006. Richard
Brooke is the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. All Non-
Executive Directors, except the Chairman, are considered independent
Directors, according to the terms of the Code. Alan Jackson, the Chairman,
is not deemed independent due to his remuneration arrangements.  e
terms of these arrangements are set out in the Remuneration Report on
pages 36 to 43. Stephen  omas is the Chief Executive and is responsible
for the Executive leadership and co-ordination of the Group's business
activities.  e structure of the Board provides a balance whereby no
individual or small group can dominate the Board's decision-making.
Details of each Director's other directorships are disclosed in the Board 
of Directors information.
 e Board is responsible for setting the Group's strategic direction, the
establishment of Group policies and internal controls and the monitoring
of operational performance. It meets regularly throughout the year and in
addition to the routine reporting of financial and operational issues,
reviews each of the trading divisions and key functions in detail, including
regular departmental functional reviews.
 e Board has a schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision
and delegates certain powers to the Board Committees and to the
Executive Directors collectively and individually.  e schedule of reserved
matters is periodically reviewed by the Board and presently includes
management of shareholder communication, annual budgets, strategic
plans, approval of major capital expenditure in excess of  1.0m and
significant financing.
Information is normally provided to all Board members in the week prior
to a Board meeting to enable the Directors to consider the issues for
discussion and to request clarification or additional information.  e Board
regularly reviews the type and amount of information provided.  e Board
plans to meet ten times a year and, in addition, has a further meeting for
consideration of strategic issues facing the Group.  e Board also holds
additional meetings to fulfil the ongoing requirements of the business
during the year, as appropriate.
All Directors have access to the advice of the Company Secretary, who is
responsible to the Board for ensuring that procedures are followed. 
 e appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is reserved 
for the consideration of the Board as a whole. In addition, there is an
agreed procedure for seeking independent professional advice at the
Group's expense. 
On appointment to the Board, every Director is provided with
opportunities for appropriate training to enable them to discharge their
duties as a Director. It is the intention of the Group to create 
opportunities for the Senior Independent Director and Non-Executive
Directors to meet with significant shareholders, should this be requested
by those shareholders.
During the year ended 28 February 2008, the Non-Executive Directors met
without the Chairman and provided feedback to the Chairman following
that meeting.  e Chairman has also provided feedback to the Non-
Executive Directors.
Board members are appointed by the Board on the recommendation of
the Nominations Committee, which is chaired by the Chairman and
consists of the Non-Executive Directors, although the Chief Executive is
invited to meetings, as appropriate. 
 e Group's Articles of Association provide that one-third (or the number
nearest to but not exceeding one-third) of the Directors shall retire from
o ce by rotation. Furthermore, Article 87 of the Articles of Association
requires a Director to stand for re-election if they were not appointed or
re-appointed at either of the last two Annual General Meetings (AGM). 
Stephen  omas is therefore retiring by rotation and is o ering himself for
re-election at the forthcoming AGM.
 e Board has concluded a review of its e ectiveness.  e conclusions of
the review have been discussed by the Board as a whole and will be kept
under review during the forthcoming year. 
Subject to re-election at the first AGM after which they are appointed, all
Non-Executive Directors are appointed initially for a three year term and,
after review, will normally be proposed for a further three year term.  e
Group will take into account the balance of skills and experience on the
Board, their contribution and level of independence when considering
whether to extend their appointment beyond the initial term. In
exceptional circumstances, the Board may ask a Non-Executive Director to
remain for a further term.  e Non-Executive Directors' contracts are
terminable on three months notice on either side.  e appointment of the
Chairman is terminable on six months notice on either side.
 e Board takes significant measures to ensure that all Board members are
kept aware of both the views of major shareholders and changes in the
major shareholdings of the Group.  is is achieved in a variety of ways,
including:
full feedback of shareholder reviews are passed by the Chairman, Chief
Executive and Finance Director who are primarily charged with
meeting shareholders;
the Board receives regular feedback from the Group's stockbrokers;
changes in current shareholdings are also presented to the Board
prompting discussions on shareholder issues;
following interim and full year announcements the Board is provided
with a full copy of analysts' reports and feedback from analysts and
shareholders on a no-names basis;
significant shareholder movements are notified to the Board by the
Company Secretary on an ad hoc basis;
all Directors are invited to analysts' briefings and have access, if
required, to the Group's stockbrokers; and
the Board has procedures in place for full agreement of all significant
announcements to the City.

AuDIT cOMMITTEE
 e Audit Committee is chaired by John Jackson and also comprised,
during the financial year, of Richard Brooke and Debbie hewitt.  e terms
of reference for the Audit Committee provide that the Chairman is invited
to attend all meetings and the Chief Executive and Finance Director are
invited to attend meetings, as appropriate.
 e Committee meets during the year and reports to the Board on all
matters relating to the regulatory and accounting requirements that may
a ect the Group, together with the financial reporting and internal control
procedures including the annual and interim financial statements. In
addition, the Audit Committee ensures that an objective and professional
relationship is maintained with the external auditors, with particular regard
to the nature and extent of any non-audit functions they provide.
During the year ended 28 February 2008, the Group's external auditors,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC ), provided advice to the Group,
including advice in relation to the issue of the Prospectus and the
Proposals for the Return of Capital to Shareholders pursuant to the
Scheme of Arrangement under S425 Companies Act 1985 and related tax
advice.  e fees paid to PwC for non-audit services were  0.3m (2007:
 0.7m) excluding VAT.  e use of PwC for non-audit work was carefully
evaluated by the Audit Committee. Non-audit work was performed by
separate teams which were segregated to the degree required to achieve
the necessary independence and to maintain the auditors' objectivity.  e
Audit Committee views the independence and objectivity of the Group's
auditors as essential and ensures that PwC are not instructed on any issues,
which would prejudice this. To ensure that this occurs, the Group operates
a policy under which any non-audit work is subject to competitive tender
and if such work has a value in excess of  50,000, it is also referred to the
Audit Committee for approval.  e Audit Committee obtains written
confirmation on at least an annual basis of the independence of the
external auditors.
 e Audit Committee also reviews the possible risks facing the Group, the
risk management function and internal controls.  e latter are dealt with in
greater detail below.  e Group has a head of Business Assurance, Mark
Wyatt, who reports to the Finance Director and to the Audit Committee
and who is responsible for ensuring the management of this process across
the range of the Group's activities.  e head of Business Assurance reports
at least twice a year to the Audit Committee regarding risk and internal
control matters, and the full Board reviews risk and internal controls at
least annually.
Steps have been taken to ensure that there is an opportunity for any
employee, in confidence, to raise concerns with management about
possible impropriety in financial or other matters.  e Group has
established an internal hotline, which is independent of line management
and intends to undertake further reviews to increase awareness of the
process including training for managers who may have to deal with
whistle-blowing issues.
 e terms of reference for the Audit Committee are available from the
Company Secretary and also appear on the corporate website at
www.luminar.co.uk.
 e external auditors may attend all meetings of the Audit Committee and
have direct access to the Audit Committee and its Chairman at all times. 
REMuNERATION cOMMITTEE
 e Remuneration Committee is chaired by Debbie hewitt and consists of
all the Non-Executive Directors, except the Chairman.  e Chairman is
invited to attend all meetings.  e Remuneration Report is set out on
pages 36 to 43.
NOMINATIONs cOMMITTEE
 e Nominations Committee is chaired by Alan Jackson and also consists
of all the Non-Executive Directors. It monitors and reviews the
membership of and succession to the Board of Directors. It makes
recommendations to the Board, inter alia, on the identification and
recruitment of potential Executive and Non-Executive Directors.  e
Nominations Committee only met once in the year ended 28 February
2008 to consider the appointment of Andy Marks as Commercial Director,
which it recommended to the Board for approval. 
OPERATIONAl sTRucTuRE

INTERNAl cONTROl
As stated above, the Board is responsible for the ongoing process of
identifying and evaluating the significant risks faced by the Group, both
financial and non-financial.  is responsibility includes clearly determining
the control environment and reviewing its e ectiveness. however, such a
system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss. 
Approximately every two months a register of key risks is submitted to the
Operating Committee of Luminar Leisure Limited for approval and
discussion.  e Operating Committee is responsible for the day-to-day
management of risks within the Group.  e register of key risks covers all
material controls including financial, operational and compliance controls.
 ese discussions are minuted.  e discussions are facilitated by the head
of Business Assurance who highlights areas of concern within the register.
 e Operating Committee is asked to propose any amendments to the
register that it deems appropriate, but also to confirm that it is content
that the register presents a true and fair view of the key risks facing the
business, and associated controls. Actions relating to certain risks are
recorded as necessary. Key issues identified as a result of the new risk based
internal audit process are also identified within the paper.

THE REMuNERATION cOMMITTEE
During the year ended 28 February 2008, the Remuneration Committee
consisted of the following Non-Executive Directors: 
David Longbottom to 13 April 2007 
Debbie hewitt 
John Jackson 
Martin Gatto to 8 August 2007
Richard Brooke 
Debbie hewitt replaced David Longbottom as Chair of the Remuneration
Committee following his resignation on 13 April 2007. 
 e members of the Remuneration Committee are all independent Non-
Executive Directors.  e Company Chairman (Alan Jackson) is invited to
attend Remuneration Committee meetings.  e Remuneration
Committee has also received assistance from Stephen  omas, the Chief
Executive, Liz Purdy, the human Resources Director, and Tim O'Gorman,
the Company Secretary. No-one took part in discussions in respect of
matters relating to their own remuneration. 
In March 2007, the Committee appointed hewitt New Bridge Street
(hNBS ), a firm of independent remuneration consultants, to advise on
senior Executive remuneration and employee share schemes. hNBS has no
other connection with the Group other than the provision of advice on
Executive remuneration.  e terms of engagement for hNBS are available
from the Company Secretary on request. 
 e Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting the remuneration
of the Company Chairman, Executive Directors and their direct reports
and the operation of any share-based incentive schemes (including all
employee schemes). In determining its policy, the Committee has regard
to the principles and provisions of the Combined Code as well as the
Stock Exchange Listing Rules and associated guidance on good
governance.  e Committee operates under the delegated authority of
the Board and its terms of reference are available from the Company
Secretary on request.
REMuNERATION POlIcY 
 e Remuneration Committee determines the Group's policy on the
remuneration of the Executive Directors. 
 e principles which underpin the remuneration policies for the 
Group are: 
to ensure that senior Executive rewards and incentives are directly
aligned with the interests of the shareholders, in order to optimise the
performance of the Group and create sustained growth in shareholder
value; 
to provide the level of remuneration required to attract, retain and
motivate Executive Directors of an appropriate calibre; 
to ensure a proper balance of fixed and variable performance related
components, linked to short and longer-term objectives; and 
to reflect market competitiveness, taking account of the total value of
all the benefit components. 
Remuneration for the Executive Directors is structured so that the variable
pay element (annual bonus and long-term incentives) forms a significant
proportion of the overall package. Whilst the balance between the fixed
and variable elements varies dependent on the performance of both the
Group and the individual, at a target  level of performance, variable pay
accounts for 53% of the average total remuneration package for the two
Executive Directors. 
At maximum  performance (assuming the achievement of maximum
bonus and full vesting of shares under the Group's long-term incentive
arrangements), variable pay accounts for 74% of the average total
remuneration package for the two Executive Directors. 
 is demonstrates the significant weighting of the package towards
variable (performance related) pay. 
Remuneration Mix: Target Performance
Fixed pay 47%
Short-term variable 18%
Long-term variable 35%
Remuneration Mix: Maximum Performance
Fixed pay 26%
Short-term variable 20%
Long-term variable 54%

INDIVIDuAl ElEMENTs OF REMuNERATION
 e main components of the remuneration package for Executive
Directors are as follows: 
(a) Salary 
Salaries for each Executive Director are determined by the Remuneration
Committee taking into account the experience and performance of the
individual and comparisons with peer group companies within its sector.
Base salaries are reviewed annually (unless responsibilities change). In
setting appropriate salary levels for the Executive Directors, the Committee
takes into account pay and employment conditions of employees
elsewhere in the Group. 
 e base salary for Stephen  omas and Nick Beighton e ective from 
1 March 2008 is  461,250 and  285,975 respectively, an increase of 2.5% 
on the prior year. Six per cent of each base salary is salary sacrificed for
pension (see page 40).
(b) Annual bonus 
 e annual bonus is designed to drive and reward excellent short-term
operating performance of the Group.  e maximum bonus opportunity is
100% of salary. 
For 2008/09, 80% of total bonus will be based on the profit before tax
sliding scale and 20% on specific business objectives. 
(c) Long-term incentives 
 e luminar group Holdings 2007 Performance share Plan (PsP ) 
 e PSP (which was approved at the 2007 AGM) has replaced the existing
Deferred Bonus Plan and Share Option Scheme. Under the PSP , Executives
(including the Executive Directors) may receive annual grants of shares that
normally will vest after three years subject to the satisfaction of challenging
performance conditions and the requirement for continued employment. 
It is intended that in the 2008/09 financial year, awards will be made over
shares worth 200% of base salary for Stephen  omas and 150% of base
salary for Nick Beighton.  e Committee believes that it is appropriate to
grant awards at this level to su ciently retain and incentivise the Executive
Directors in this current trading environment and to retain their services.
In particular, the Committee notes that the recent fall in the Group's share
price provides little lock-in for the Executive Directors.  e Committee has
taken into account the exceptional grant sizes when determining the
performance conditions attached to the grants. 
 e first awards granted under the PSP (on 9 November 2007) are subject
to a mixture of Total Shareholder Return (TSR ) and strategic
performance conditions (for details see page 40). For 2008/09 and
subsequent performance cycles, the TSR performance condition will
continue to apply to 50% of any awards and stretching three-year EPS
growth targets will apply to the other 50% of any awards. Both metrics will
be measured over a period of three years. 
For awards granted in the 2008/09 financial year, the benchmark for the
relative TSR condition will be the companies comprising the FTSE Small
Cap Index (excluding investment trusts) as at the date of grant. Twenty-
five per cent of this part of the award will vest if Luminar's TSR is equal to
the median company's TSR. Full vesting requires Luminar's TSR to be at or
above the upper quintile.  ere will be incremental vesting between
median and upper quintile. 
For the 2008/09 awards, it is intended that the Earnings Per Share (EPS )
growth targets will be based on the growth in pre-exceptional EPS over the
period of three financial years. For aggregate awards up to 100% of base
salary (i.e. of which half is based on EPS), 25% of the award will vest if EPS
growth is equal to RPI+ 3% p.a. with full vesting requiring growth at
RPI+ 7% p.a. For awards in excess of 100% of base salary, there will be
incremental vesting between RPI+ 7% p.a. (0% vesting) and RPI+ 10% p.a.
(100% vesting) for the awards subject to the EPS performance condition
(i.e. 50% of the excess).
Under a new policy adopted by the Remuneration Committee in 2007,
Executive Directors are encouraged to build and maintain a shareholding
in the Group worth at least 100% of base salary. Until such time as this
threshold has been achieved, there is a requirement to retain at least 50%
of the shares (after tax) released under Executive share schemes. Details of
the current shareholdings for the Executive Directors are shown in the
table of Directors' interests on page 44. Based on the share price at the 
year end of  3.68 per share, Stephen  omas' shareholding of 278,356
shares was equivalent to 228% of his salary and Nick Beighton's
shareholding of 12,496 shares was equivalent to 16.5% of his salary. Nick
Beighton joined the Company in August 2005 and is in the process of
building up his shareholding.
(d) Pension entitlements 
 e Executive Directors' pension contributions are paid into Self Invested
Pension Plans (SIPPs).  e Executive Directors each sacrifice 6% of their
salary into a SIPP , to which the Company contributes 25% of salary in the
case of Stephen  omas and 15% in the case of Nick Beighton.
EXEcuTIVE DIREcTORs' sERVIcE cONTRAcTs
 e Remuneration Committee's policy is to o er service contracts with
notice periods of one year or less. 
Stephen  omas' contract of service (dated 28 January 2008) is terminable
on 12 months notice by either party. Nick Beighton's contract of service
(dated 1 August 2005) is terminable on six months notice by either party. 
Upon termination, the Executive Directors are entitled to salary and
benefits for the duration of the notice period. It is the policy of the
Remuneration Committee to seek to mitigate termination payments.
 e Executive Directors are subject to a 12 month non-compete clause
from the date of termination. 
 e Executive Directors are employed on rolling contracts with a
retirement age of 65. 
EXTERNAl DIREcTORsHIPs FOR EXEcuTIVE DIREcTORs
 e Executive Directors are allowed to be appointed as a Non-Executive
Director at other companies at the discretion of the Board. Before granting
permission the Board will take into account the time commitment of the
new role and the competitive status of the other company. Stephen
 omas is a Non-Executive Director of other companies, as detailed on
page 30, and retained fees paid to him during the year in the performance
of external commitments for  e Food & Drink Group Plc of  55,000.
Stephen  omas and Nick Beighton are Non-Executive Directors of  e
3D Entertainment Group Limited as detailed on page 30. Both Stephen
 omas' and Nick Beighton's fees for being Non-Executive Directors of
 e 3D Entertainment Group Limited are paid to the Group.

NON-EXEcuTIVE DIREcTORs
All Non-Executive Directors are appointed initially for a three year term and, after review, will normally be proposed for a further three year term.  e
Group will take into account the balance of skills and experience of the Board, their contribution and level of independence when considering whether to
extend their appointment beyond the initial three year term. In exceptional circumstances, the Board may ask a Non-Executive Director to remain for a
further three year term. Non-Executive Directors' appointments are terminable on either three or six months notice on either side. 
Details of their current three year appointments are as follows:

last year's Remuneration Report), are not entitled to bonus payments or pension arrangements, nor do they ordinarily participate in the Group's long-term
incentive schemes. Fees for the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association and are based on
information on fees paid in similar companies, taking into account the experience of the individuals and the relative time commitments involved.

 e 9 November 2007 awards will become exercisable on 1 August 2010 subject to continued employment and the achievement of the performance
conditions.  is vesting period (which is slightly shorter than the usual three years) reflected the delay in granting awards caused by the Group
reorganisation and return of capital to shareholders, which was e ected in 2007 (the Reorganisation ). had it not been for the impending Reorganisation,
awards would have been granted following the adoption of the PSP at the 2007 AGM in July 2007. 
For the awards granted on 9 November 2007 to Executive Directors, the following performance conditions apply:
Fifty per cent of the awards will vest based on the relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR ) performance of the Group compared to the FTSE 250
Index measured over the period from grant to 31 July 2010. Twenty-five per cent (of this part of the award) will vest if the Group's TSR performance
matches that of the FTSE 250 Index increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting (of this part of the award) if the Group's TSR performance exceeds
that of the FTSE 250 Index by 40%. Vesting will be determined on a straight-line basis between these two points. 
 e other 50% of the awards will vest dependent on the satisfaction of four strategic milestones by the 2009/10 financial year end. Twenty per cent of
the award will be based on the Return on Investment (ROI ) target (increasing ROI after tax to 25% per annum) and 10% of the award will be based
on each of the other three targets (achieving central cost savings of  3.5m- 4.0m, reducing sta  turnover from 220% to 140%-120% and returning
 70.0m- 100.0m to shareholders). Except for the ROI target (which is a single hurdle), 25% of each part of the award will vest for achieving the initial
threshold increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting of the relevant part of the award for achieving the upper limit. 
With e ect from 19 October 2007, Luminar Group holdings plc was inserted as the new holding company of the Luminar Group.  e performance
conditions take into account the performance of Luminar plc before the Reorganisation was e ected and Luminar Group holdings plc thereafter.

A matching shares award will become exercisable subject to the TSR performance of the Group compared to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index over
each three year performance period (commencing with the financial year in which the award was made). 12.5% of the awards will vest for median TSR
performance increasing on a straight-line basis, so that 100% of the awards will vest for top decile TSR performance. No shares will become exercisable if
the Group's TSR is ranked below median. 
Stephen  omas' 2004 deferred bonus award vested during the year. As at 28 February 2007 (the end of the performance period for the 2004 matching
awards), Luminar was ranked between median and upper decile against the comparator group, resulting in 0.369 matching shares vesting for each
deferred bonus share. Luminar's share price on the date of vesting (24 August 2007) was  6.86.
Stephen  omas was paid an additional cash sum of  4,883 in respect of the dividends that would have been paid in July 2007 on the post-tax number of
shares acquired pursuant to his 2004 deferred bonus and matching awards (he did not receive that dividend because of the administrative delay in
providing him with the shares to satisfy his awards).  at sum was calculated so that, after deduction of income tax and National Insurance
Contributions, Stephen  omas was in the same position as if he had received the sum as a dividend and been taxed as such. 
Participants are required to pay employer's National Insurance Contributions arising in connection with the vesting of their deferred bonus and matching
shares awards.  e settlement of benefits accruing under the Deferred Bonus Plan is in equity or cash, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
Outstanding awards under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan were rolled over on their original terms into equivalent awards over shares in Luminar Group
holdings plc in connection with the Reorganisation.

sHARE OPTIONs
 e share options are exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant. 
Options were originally granted subject to performance conditions requiring Earnings Per Share (EPS ) growth (calculated pre-exceptional items and tax)
over a three year period. For options granted in 1998 and 1999, the EPS growth hurdle is RPI +20% per annum compound. For options granted between
2000 and 2002, the EPS growth hurdle is RPI +5% per annum compound. For options granted in 2003, the EPS growth hurdle is RPI +3% per annum
compound. 
Outstanding options held by Executive Directors (see below) were rolled over into equivalent options over shares in Luminar Group holdings plc in
connection with the Reorganisation. however, following the technical change of control of Luminar plc in connection with the Reorganisation, the Rules
of the 1996 Executive Share Option Scheme prescribed that unapproved options became immediately exercisable, with performance conditions falling
away (this was a standard feature in rules of this vintage).  erefore, the exercise of the rolled over unapproved options is not subject to any performance
conditions. Similarly, rolled over approved options are not subject to performance conditions, as prescribed by the rules of the 1999 Company Share
Option Plan (a common provision in rules of this vintage).

1999 WARRANT scHEME TRusT
In 1999, the shareholders of Luminar plc approved the establishment of a
discretionary trust to hold warrants as part of incentive arrangements
under which the warrants would be subsequently allocated to employees.
Each warrant carried the right to subscribe for one ordinary share at a
subscription price of  6.67  per share.  e performance criteria attached
to the warrant scheme were met in full in February 2002.  e warrants
may be exercised in the period of 28 days following the publication of the
Annual Report of each financial year up to the year ending on or around 
1 March 2009. 
Outstanding warrants held by Executive Directors were rolled over on
their original terms into equivalent warrants over shares in Luminar Group
holdings plc in connection with the Reorganisation. 
At 28 February 2008, Stephen  omas held 1,629,789 unexercised warrants
(2007: 43,410). During the year, the trust allocated 1,620,129 warrants that
were previously unallocated, of which Stephen  omas was allocated
1,586,379 warrants. As disclosed in last year's Remuneration Report, there
had been a long-standing agreement that those warrants were for the
benefit of Stephen  omas. 
REsTRIcTED sHARE AWARDs
As reported in last year's remuneration report, in July 2006 the
Remuneration Committee made a one-o  retention award of 47,900
restricted shares to Nick Beighton, the Finance Director. Fifty per cent of
the shares vested in 2007 (together with 400 shares acquired under the
dividend equivalent provisions in Nick Beighton's award agreement).  e
share price on the date of vesting (24 August 2007) was  6.86.  e
remainder of the award will vest in July 2008, subject to his continued
employment with Luminar.
 e unvested portion of the award was rolled over on its original terms
into an equivalent award over shares in Luminar Group holdings plc in
connection with the Reorganisation. 
ONE-OFF PHANTOM lONg-TERM INcENTIVE AWARD TO
THE cHAIRMAN
As reported in last year's remuneration report, in order to secure the
services of Alan Jackson as Chairman, the Remuneration Committee
considered it necessary to o er a one-o  cash award over 73,314 notional
shares, granted under Listing Rule 9.4.2(2) (the Phantom Award ). 
Vesting of the Phantom Award is based on the Group's TSR performance
over a three year vesting period. Forty per cent of the Phantom Award will
vest if Luminar's TSR is equal to the TSR of the median company.  e
Phantom Award will vest in full if Luminar's TSR is equal to or above the
TSR of the upper quartile company. Straight-line vesting will occur
between these points. TSR values will be the average over the three
months prior to the beginning and end of the performance period. 
 e award was rolled over on its original terms into an equivalent
phantom award over notional shares in Luminar Group holdings plc in
connection with the Reorganisation.

Company's compliance with the nine provisions of the Combined Code
(2006) specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the Board's statements on internal control cover all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the e ectiveness of the Group's corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited Group financial statements.  e
other information comprises only the Financial highlights, the Chairman's
Statement, the Business Review, the Corporate Social Responsibility
statement, the details of the Board of Directors, the Corporate Governance
Statement, the Remuneration Report and the Report of the Directors. We
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other
information.
BAsIs OF AuDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the Group financial statements. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the
Directors in the preparation of the Group financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group's
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with su cient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
Group financial statements.
OPINION
In our opinion:
the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the
Group's a airs as at 28 February 2008 and of its profit and cash flows
for the year then ended;
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation; and
the information given in the Directors' Report is consistent with the
Group financial statements.

PRINcIPAl AccOuNTINg POlIcIEs FOR THE 
cONsOlIDATED FINANcIAl sTATEMENTs
FoR THE YEAR EnDED 28 FEBRuARY 2008
 e principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial
statements are set out below.  ese policies have been consistently applied
to all years presented, unless otherwise stated. 
BAsIs OF PREPARATION
 e consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union and International Financial Reporting Interpretations
Committee (IFRIC) and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985
applicable to companies reporting under IFRSs.  e Group has complied
with those IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations where the implementation date is
relevant to the financial year ended 28 February 2008 but has not early
adopted other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations.
On 19 October 2007 Luminar Group holdings plc replaced Luminar plc as
the listed holding company for the Group and undertook a Scheme of
Arrangement in order to create su cient distributable reserves to facilitate
its plans for returning cash to shareholders.  e consolidated financial
statements include the results of the Group from 2 March 2007 to
28 February 2008, as merger accounting has been adopted and there is
no change to the ultimate controlling shareholders of the Group.
 e financial statements of the Company as an entity are prepared under
UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and are presented separately
from these consolidated financial statements (pages 97 to 111 within this
Annual Report).
 e financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis,
except for non-current assets and disposal groups and investments held for
sale measured at their fair value less costs to sell and financial assets and
liabilities recorded at fair value.
 e preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and
assumptions that a ect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based
on management's best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual
results may ultimately di er from those estimates.
Comparative income statement and cash flow information for the year
ended 1 March 2007 has been reclassified to reflect the composition of the
divisions at the balance sheet date. 
IMPAcT OF NEW AccOuNTINg sTANDARDs
 e following new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations
are mandatory for the first time for the financial year ended 28 February
2008.
IFRIC 7, Applying the restatement approach under IAs 29, e ective for annual
periods beginning on or after 1 March 2006.  is interpretation has had no
impact on the Group.
IFRIC 8, scope of IFrs 2, e ective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 May 2006.  is interpretation has not had any impact on the recognition
of share-based payments in the Group.
IFRIC 9, reassessment of embedded derivatives, e ective for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 June 2006.  is interpretation has had no impact on
the Group.
IFRIC 10, Interims and impairment, e ective for annual periods beginning on
or after 1 November 2006.  is interpretation has had no impact on the
timing or recognition of impairment losses as the Group already accounted
for such amounts using principles consistent with IFRIC 10.
IFRS 7, Financial instruments: Disclosures, e ective for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2007.  is standard introduces new
disclosures relating to financial instruments and does not have any impact
on the classification and valuation of the Group's financial instruments, or
the disclosures relating to taxation and trade and other payables.
IAS 1, presentation of financial statements   Capital disclosures, e ective for
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007.  is standard
introduces new disclosures relating to capital management and has no
classification or measurement impact on the Group's financial statements.
IFRIC 11, IFrs 2 Group and treasury share transactions, e ective for annual
periods beginning on or after 1 March 2007. Management have adopted this
standard during the year.
Impact of accounting standards issued but not adopted
 e Group has considered all new accounting standards which have been
published at 28 February 2008 but are not yet e ective.  e current
assessment of these standards is that they will not have a significant impact
on the Group.
IFRIC 12, service concession arrangements, e ective for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2008. Management do not expect this
interpretation to have any impact on the Group.
IFRS 8, operating segments, e ective for annual periods beginning on or after
1 January 2009, subject to EU endorsement. Management are currently
gathering information to make a revision to the Group's geographical
segments. Management do not currently foresee any significant changes to
the Group's business segments. 
Revised IAS 23, Borrowing costs, e ective for annual periods beginning on or
after 1 January 2009.  is standard requires an entity to capitalise borrowing
costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a
qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset.  e option of immediately
expensing those borrowing costs has been removed.  is will have no
impact on the Group as these borrowing costs are already being capitalised.
Revised IAS 1, presentation of financial statements, e ective for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2009.  is standard changes the presentation
of items of income and expenses in the statement of changes in equity,
requiring  non-owner changes in equity' to be presented separately from
owner changes in equity.  e standard also introduces additional
requirements for entities that are making restatements or reclassifications of
comparative information.  is will only a ect the disclosure of items within
the Group financial statements.
14756LUMINAR:Layout 1  11/6/08  12:11  Page 55 IAS 27 (Revised), Consolidated and separate financial statements, e ective for
annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.  is standard requires the
e ects of all transactions with non-controlling interests to be recorded in
equity if there is no change in control.  e impact of this on the Group will
depend on future acquisitions.
IFRS 3 (Revised), Business combinations, e ective for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2009.  is standard continues to apply the
acquisition method to business combinations, with some significant
changes.  e impact of this on the Group will depend on future acquisitions.
Amendment to IFRS 2, share-based payment, e ective for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2009.  is standard deals with vesting
conditions and cancellations. It clarifies that vesting conditions are service
conditions and performance conditions only, and that all cancellations,
whether by the entity or by other parties, should receive the same
accounting treatment. Management do not expect this standard will impact
on the Group's accounting for the existing share option schemes.
Amendment to IAS 32, Financial instruments: presentation, e ective for
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.  is standard requires
entities to classify certain types of financial instruments as equity, provided
they have particular features and meet specific conditions. Management do
not expect this standard to have any impact on the Group.
IFRIC 14, IAS 19,  e limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding
requirements and their interaction, e ective for annual periods beginning on
or after 1 January 2008. Since the Group does not operate a defined benefit
pension scheme, this is not relevant to the Group.
IFRIC 13, Customer loyalty programmes relating to IAs 18, revenue, e ective for
annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008.  is standard deals with
the required accounting for customer loyalty programmes where goods or
services are sold together with a customer loyalty incentive. Management
do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the Group.
AlTERNATIVE PREsENTATION WITHIN THE
cONsOlIDATED INcOME sTATEMENT
 e Group has presented separately, on the face of the Consolidated
Income Statement on page 51, the profit/(loss) from trading operations and
exceptional items relating to the closure of properties.  is presentation has
been adopted to more clearly distinguish the profit/(loss) from ongoing
operations of the Group, (i.e. profit/(loss) from trading operations ), from
those items presented within continuing operations, (i.e. exceptional items
relating to the closure of properties ) that relate to closed operations.
 ese exceptional costs relating to the closure of properties have arisen
following the Group's exit from non-core operations.  ese items have
been presented within continuing operations as they do not meet the
criteria to be held for sale, as they were not actively marketed prior to the
balance sheet date, and therefore cannot be presented as discontinued
operations, in accordance with IFRS 5, non-current assets held for sale and
discontinued operations.
 e presentation of profit/(loss) from trading operations  separately on the
face of the Consolidated Income Statement is relevant to explain the financial
performance of the ongoing Group. Additional information on the
performance of the Group is included in the notes to the financial statements.
EXcEPTIONAl ITEMs
 e Group classifies items of income and expenses as exceptional items,
where the nature of the item, or its size, is likely to be material so as to assist
the user of the financial statements to better understand the results of the
operations of the Group.
BAsIs OF cONsOlIDATION
 e consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements
of the Group and entities controlled by the Group. 
Control is achieved where the Group has the power to govern the financial
and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its
activities. Control is normally evidenced when the Group either directly or
indirectly owns more than 50% of the voting rights or potential voting rights
of a Group's share capital.
BusINEss cOMBINATIONs
Under the requirements of IFRS 3, Business combinations, all business
combinations are accounted for using the purchase method (acquisition
accounting ).  e cost of a business combination is the aggregate of the fair
values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or
assumed, equity instruments issued by the acquirer and any costs directly
attributable to the business combination.
On acquisition of a subsidiary, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
of a subsidiary are measured at their fair value at that date. Any excess of the
cost of acquisition over the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as
goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of
the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited
to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period of acquisition.
 e results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are
included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the e ective date of
acquisition or up to the e ective date of disposal.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated
on consolidation.
NON-cuRRENT AssETs HElD FOR sAlE
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their
carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction
rather than continuing use.  is condition is regarded as met only when a
sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for
immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed
to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a
completed sale within one year from the date of classification. Disposal
groups are groups of assets, and liabilities directly associated with those
assets, that are to be disposed of together as a group in a single transaction. 
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are
initially measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to
sell. At subsequent reporting dates non-current assets (and disposal groups)
are remeasured to the latest estimate of fair value less costs to sell. As a 
result of this remeasurement any impairment is recognised as a charge in 
the Consolidated Income Statement. Any increase in fair value is credited 
to the Consolidated Income Statement to the extent of previous
impairment charges.

FoR THE YEAR EnDED 28 FEBRuARY 2008
14756LUMINAR:Layout 1  11/6/08  12:11  Page 56 DIscONTINuED OPERATIONs
Discontinued operations represent cash generating units or groups of cash
generating units, that have either been disposed of or classified as held for
sale, and represent a separate major line of business or are part of a single co-
ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business. Cash
generating units forming part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a
separate major line of business are classified within continuing operations
until they meet the criteria to be held for sale.
 e post-tax profit or loss of the discontinued operation is classified as a
single line on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement, together with
any post-tax gain or loss recognised on the remeasurement to fair value less
costs to sell or on the disposal of the assets or disposal group constituting
the discontinued operation. 
On changes to the composition of groups of units comprising discontinued
operations, the presentation of discontinued operations within prior periods
is restated to reflect consistent classification of discontinued operations
across all periods presented.
FINANcIAl INsTRuMENTs
 e Group has applied IAS 32, Financial instruments: Disclosure and
presentation, IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition and measurement, IFRS
7, Financial instruments: Disclosures, and the complementary amendment to
IAS 1, presentation of financial statements   Capital disclosures.
Financial assets and liabilities   measurement basis
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the date on which the
Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument
giving rise to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are initially
recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Any impairment of a financial
asset is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement when incurred.
Financial assets are derecognised when the Group's rights to cash inflows
from the asset expire; financial liabilities are derecognised when the
contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
Financial assets are classified according to the purpose for which the asset
was acquired.  e Group's financial assets are classified as either:
  trade and other receivables    these are non-derivative financial assets
with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market.  ey arise when the Group provides goods or services directly to a
debtor, or advances money, with no intention of trading the loan or
receivable. Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e ective interest
method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts
due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial
di culties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or
financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are
considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.  e amount of
the provision is the di erence between the asset's carrying amount and the
present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original
e ective interest rate.  e carrying amount of the asset is reduced through
the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in
the consolidated income statement within  administrative expenses'. When a
trade receivable is uncollectable, it is written o  against the allowance
account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts 
previously written o  are credited against  administrative expenses' in the
income statement.
  cash and cash equivalents    these comprise deposits with an original
maturity of three months or less with banks and financial institutions, bank
balances, and cash on hand. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in
current liabilities on the balance sheet.
 e Group's financial liabilities are classified as either current liabilities  or
non-current liabilities .  ese are non-derivative financial liabilities with fixed
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.  ey
arise when the Group receives goods or services directly from a creditor or
supplier, or borrows money, with no intention of trading the liability.  is
category includes:
  trade and other payables   these are typically non-interest bearing and
following initial recognition at fair value, are included in the balance sheet at
amortised cost using the e ective interest method. 
  bank loans   these are initially recorded at fair value based on proceeds
received, net of issue costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at
amortised cost; any di erence between the proceeds (net of transaction
costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over
the period of the borrowings using the e ective interest method. Finance
charges are accounted for on an accruals basis and charged to the
Consolidated Income Statement using the e ective interest rate method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an
unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months
after the balance sheet date, at which point they are classified as non-
current liabilities.

FoR THE YEAR EnDED 28 FEBRuARY 2008
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting   
measurement basis
 e Group's activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in interest
rates, and the Group uses interest rate swaps to manage these exposures.  e
use of derivative financial instruments is approved by the Board of Directors.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative
contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
 e method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether
the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of
the item being hedged.  e Group designates certain derivatives as hedges
of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly
probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge).
 e Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship
between the hedging instrument and hedged items, as well as its risk
management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging
transactions.  e Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used
in hedging transactions are highly e ective in o setting changes in fair values
or cash flows of hedged items.
 e fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes
are disclosed in note 22. Movements on the hedging reserve in shareholders'
equity are shown on page 54.  e full fair value of a hedging derivative is
classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining hedged item
matures in more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability when the
remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. 
Cash flow hedges
 e e ective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are
designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in equity.  e gain
or loss relating to the ine ective portion is recognised immediately in the
income statement within  finance costs'.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in
the periods when the hedged item a ects profit or loss.  e gain or loss
relating to the e ective portion of interest rate swaps hedging variable rate
borrowings is recognised in the income statement within  finance costs'.  e
gain or loss relating to the ine ective portion is recognised in the income
statement within  finance costs'. however, when the forecast transaction
that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for
example, inventory or fixed assets), the gains and losses previously deferred
in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial
measurement of the cost of the asset.  e deferred amounts are ultimately
recognised in the cost of goods sold in the case of inventory or in
depreciation in the case of fixed assets.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing
in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast
transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a
forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or
loss that was reported in equity, is immediately transferred to the income
statement within  finance costs'.
 e Group has no embedded derivatives that are not closely related to the
host instrument. 
PROVIsIONs
Provisions for onerous lease commitments, public liability insurance claims
and other provisions are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is more likely than not
that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the
obligation; and the amount can be measured reliably.
gOODWIll
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair
value of the Group's share of the net identifiable assets and liabilities of the
acquired business at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an
asset and is reviewed for impairment at least annually and goodwill is
allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing at
the level of reportable segments. Any impairment is recognised immediately
in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed. Goodwill is
carried at cost less aggregated impairment losses.
On the disposal of a subsidiary or cash generating unit, the attributable
amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on
disposal. 
OTHER INTANgIBlE AssETs
Acquired trademarks are included at purchase cost and amortised over their
finite useful economic lives on a straight-line basis.
Intangibles acquired separately and through business combinations, i.e.
licences and other intangible assets, where material, are included at cost or
fair value respectively and amortised over their useful economic lives, being
the shorter of the term of the lease to which they are attached or the
licence.
Acquired software assets not integral to the operation of the related
hardware are included at cost and amortised over their estimated finite
useful economic lives   three years on a straight-line basis.
 e Group does not carry out research and development activities that may
lead to the recognition of internally generated intangible assets.  e Group's
internally generated brands represent commercially valuable intangibles but
are not eligible for recognition as assets under IAS 38, Intangible Assets.

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or
receivable and represents amounts recoverable by the Group for goods and
services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT
and other sales related taxes.
(a) Sale of goods
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are provided and the title has
passed, at the point of cash receipt.
(b) Admission and services revenue 
Admission revenue is recognised when the service is provided.
(c) Sub-lease rental income
Sub-lease rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of
the related sub-lease agreement.
(d) Commission income
Commission income is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with
the substance of the relevant agreement. 
INTEREsT INcOME
Interest income is accrued by reference to the principal outstanding and at
the e ective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts
estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial
asset to that asset's net carrying amount.
BORROWINg cOsTs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or
production of assets are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as
the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other
borrowing costs are dealt within the income statement in the period in
which they are incurred.
EquITY DIVIDENDs
Final dividends are recognised in the Group's financial statements in the
period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders. Interim
dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.
DIVIDEND INcOME
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders'
rights to receive payment have been established.
PROPERTY, PlANT AND EquIPMENT
All classes of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of
depreciation and any recognised impairment losses. Cost includes other
directly attributable costs, e.g. professional fees, and, for qualifying assets,
borrowing costs capitalised. Depreciation is not charged during the period
of construction, and commences when the assets are ready for their
intended use.
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost or valuation, less the
estimated residual value of all assets, other than land, by equal annual
instalments over their estimated useful lives.
 e periods generally applicable are:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings and related structural fixtures and
fittings   50 years
Short leasehold buildings and related structural fixtures and fittings  
over the period of the lease
Other fixtures and fittings, furniture and equipment   between two
years and ten years
Motor vehicles   three years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful
lives on the same basis as owned assets, or, where shorter, the term of the
relevant lease.
 e assets' residual values and useful economic lives are reviewed, and
adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
An assessment is made at each reporting date if there is any indication that
an asset may be impaired. If any indications are deemed to exist, the relevant
assets are tested for impairment. Any impairment is determined as the
di erence between the higher of value in use, calculated by discounting an
estimate of future cash flows by the Group's pre-tax weighted average cost
of capital, and fair value less costs to sell, compared to the carrying value of
the relevant asset. Fair value less costs to sell is estimated by qualified
surveyors and valuers and by applying the knowledge and experience of
management, together with external market indicators. If the recoverable
amount is less than the carrying value of the asset, then the carrying value is
reduced to recoverable amount, and the resulting impairment charge is
recognised in the income statement.

FoR THE YEAR EnDED 28 FEBRuARY 2008
INVEsTMENT IN AssOcIATEs
An associate is an entity over which the Group exercises, or is in a position
to exercise, significant influence, but not control or joint control, through
participation in the financial or operating policy of the investee.
Where material, the results and assets and liabilities of associates are
incorporated in the financial statements using the equity method of
accounting, except when these associates are classified as held for sale.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost adjusted by
any material post-acquisition changes in the net assets of the associates, less
any impairment of value in the individual investments.
When the associate is classified as held for sale, the investment is held at the
lower of adjusted cost (as described above) and fair value less costs to sell
and is no longer equity accounted for, after the date the investment is
classified as held for sale.
INVENTORIEs
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is
calculated using the first in, first out method.
TAXATION
 e tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and
deferred tax.
 e tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable
profit di ers from profit before taxation as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable
or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never
taxable or deductible.  e Group's liability for current tax is calculated using
tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance
sheet date.
Where taxation computations submitted to the taxation authorities are yet
to be agreed, the Group's estimate of tax liabilities reflects the uncertainty as
to the amount of tax that may ultimately be payable.
Deferred tax is the tax accounted for in respect of temporary di erences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements, and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of
taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary di erences
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that
taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary
di erences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the
temporary di erence arises from the recognition of goodwill or the initial
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and
liabilities in a transaction that a ects neither the tax profit nor the
accounting profit.
IAS 12, Income taxes, requires that the measurement of deferred tax should
have regard to the tax consequences that would follow from the manner of
expected recovery or settlement, at the balance sheet date, of the carrying
amount of its assets and liabilities. In calculating its deferred tax liability the
Group's policy is to regard the depreciable amount of the carrying value of
its property, plant and equipment to be recovered through continuing use
in the business, unless included within assets held for sale where the policy is
to regard the carrying amount as being recoverable through sale. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the
period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is
charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement, except when it
relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the
deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
lEAsINg
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All
other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at
their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease
payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.  e corresponding
liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease
obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and
reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest
on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognised in
the Consolidated Income Statement within finance costs, unless they are
directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement
on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating
lease are included within deferred income and recognised in the
Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Premiums paid on entering into the lease of certain leasehold land and
buildings are classified as other non-current assets and amortised to the
Consolidated Income Statement over the life of the relevant lease.
Leased assets that are sub-let to third parties are classified according to their
substance as either finance or operating leases. All such arrangements the
Group has entered into as lessor are operating leases. Income received as a
lessor is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is
classified in the Consolidated Income Statement as revenue.
Leases that are entered into following the sale of assets by the Group (i.e.
sale and leaseback transactions ) are classified according to the risk and
rewards of the lease. All such arrangements entered into by the Group are
operating leases. Where the proceeds on sale of the asset exceed the asset's
fair value, and the asset is leased back as an operating lease, any surplus over
the fair value is treated as deferred income and recognised in the income
statement over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis.

A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing
products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are di erent
from those of other business segments. A geographical segment is a
distinguishable component of an entity that provides products or services
within a particular economic environment and that is subject to risks and
returns that are di erent from those of components operating in other
economic environments. 
Business segments have been designated as the primary segment as these
segments reflect the dominant source and nature of the Group's returns and
is consistent with the internal reporting structure of the Group.  e Group
has only one geographic segment, being the UK, as no regions of the UK
expose the Group to di erentiated risks and returns.
EMPlOYEE BENEFITs
Retirement benefit costs
Payments made to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are
charged as an expense when they fall due.  e Group has no defined benefit
or other retirement benefit schemes.
Share-based compensation
 e Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2, share-based payment. In
accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all
grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as
of 1 January 2005.
 e Group issues some equity instruments where the counter-party has the
choice of either cash or equity settlement, and some equity instruments
where the settlement can only be in equity.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date
of grant.  e fair value determined at grant date is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of the
shares that will actually vest, with a corresponding credit entry directly to
equity reserves. Fair value is measured by means of a binomial model.
A liability is recognised at current fair value at each balance sheet date for
cash settled share-based payments, with changes in the fair value recognised
in the Consolidated Income Statement.
cRITIcAl AccOuNTINg POlIcIEs AND EsTIMATEs 
Income taxes
Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income
taxes.  ere are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate
tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.  e
Group recognises the liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on
estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. 
In addition, any reduction in the corporation tax liability as a result of
business activities undertaken in a tax e cient manner, is fully provided for
and released in accordance with the techniques identified by IAS 37,
provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets. Where significant
progress has been made towards agreement with the relevant tax authority,
the total expected value approach is utilised. In all other cases, the most
likely outcome approach is used.
Deferred tax
 e Group has made provision for deferred tax arising following the
requirements of IAS 12, Income taxes, using estimates based on the current
manner of recovery of the assets' value of property, plant and equipment
not eligible for capital allowances, i.e. recovery of the depreciable amount
through continued use in the business unless the assets are held for sale.
 is method assumes that no tax relief will be available until the value of the
asset is recovered through sale rather than continued use.
Upon any change to the manner of recovery of the assets' value, the 
change to the level of deferred tax provided will be recognised through the
income statement during the period in which the change in the method of
recovery occurs. Any changes to the expected manner of recovery could
result in a significant change to the deferred tax charge or credit to the
income statement.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and goodwill
 e Group has tested property, plant and equipment and goodwill for
impairment following the requirements of IAS 36, Impairment of assets.
 ese impairment tests are dependent on estimates of value in use and fair
value less costs of sale to determine the recoverable amounts of cash
generating units.
Fair value less costs of sale is determined using external and internal
estimates of the value of the Group's units. Value in use is calculated using
estimated earnings and cash flows derived by internal management
estimates, and a discount applied to these cash flows.
Any changes to the level of forecast earnings or cash flows could impact
upon the value-in-use of these cash generating units. Management have
performed the annual impairment review of goodwill as required by IAS 36.
Onerous lease provisions
 e Group provides for its onerous obligations under operating leases 
where the property is closed or vacant, and the Group believes that it is
more likely than not that the property will not be redeveloped for use in the
Group's business. Provision is made for rent and other property related costs
for the period management believe a sub-let or assignment of the lease is
not possible.
Where the Group believes the lease is likely to be assigned, provision is made
for the Group's best estimate of the reverse lease premium payable, if this
represents the least cost to the Group from exiting from the obligation.
 e estimated timings and amounts of cash flows are determined using the
experience of internal and external property experts. however, any changes
to the estimated method of exiting from the property could lead to
significant changes to the level of the provision recorded.

on 25 July 2008 for shareholders on the register as at 20 June 2008 (ex-dividend date of 18 June 2008).  is dividend is subject to approval at the
Annual General Meeting, and has not been included as a liability within these financial statements in accordance with IAS 10, events after the balance

7 EARNINgs PER sHARE
 e calculation of the basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the earnings attributed to equity shareholders by the weighted average
number of shares in issue during the year. For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to
assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.  e Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: share options granted to
Directors and employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Group's ordinary shares during the year, and the
contingently issuable shares under the Group's long-term incentive plan (i.e. the Deferred Bonus Plan   see note 27). At the year end an assessment
is made as to whether the performance criteria for the vesting of awards under the share option schemes of the Group is likely to be met and any
potential shares unlikely to be exercised are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.
An alternative measure of earnings per share has been presented below, that being earnings per share from continuing operations pre-exceptional
items, as the Directors believe that this measure of pre-exceptional earnings from continuing operations is more reflective of the ongoing trading of
the Group.

 ese units, although closed, were not actively marketed prior to the balance sheet date. As a result, these units do not meet the criteria to be
classified as held for sale, and therefore have been presented within continuing operations.

(i) Exceptional items relating to trading 
 e impairment of property, plant and equipment of  1.7m (2007:  2.1m) on trading units reflects the di erence between the value in use of cash
generating units (e.g. discrete trading units) and their carrying value. 
Costs of reorganisation and rationalisation of  2.4m (2007:  1.8m) have been incurred in respect of listing Luminar Group holdings plc and
negotiating new banking facilities.  0.7m of this cost related to the share-based payment charge under IFRS 2, share based payment, which has arisen
due to the historic share options no longer being subject to performance conditions as a result of the Scheme of Arrangement.
(ii) Exceptional items relating to the closure of properties
 e impairment of property, plant and equipment of  1.2m (2007:  0.8m), has principally arisen from the closure of two non-core units. 
 e charges arising from onerous lease commitments of  1.2m (2007:  1.5m) were to recognise the obligation for rent, rates and other property
related holding costs on currently vacant or closed units, where the likelihood of assignment of the lease or sub-let of the property is unlikely in the
short term.  ese units are closed or vacant due to them being unprofitable and unsuitable for re-branding. 
During the year a  0.5m provision for onerous lease commitments was reversed due to a change in the intended use of the unit as a result of the re-
branding strategy.
During the prior year,  2.5m was received in relation to an insurance recovery claim against a unit which burnt down in 2005.  is unit had been
impaired in 2006 to  0.3m, and therefore a profit of  2.1m, after incurring costs of  0.1m, was recorded.  0.4m of this profit relating to business
interruption, was credited to administrative expenses.
(iii) Exceptional items relating to finance costs
 e Group has recognised  0.5m (2007:  nil) of unamortised costs written o  during the year in relation to the previous bank facility as an
exceptional finance cost.

8 EXcEPTIONAl ITEMs (continued)
 e impairment of property, plant and equipment of  1.1m (2007:  3.5m, and non-current assets of  0.6m) has resulted from remeasuring to fair
value less costs of sale units held for sale. 
 e provision for onerous lease commitments of  1.1m (2007:  3.7m), relating to sites presented within discontinued operations, has arisen from the
closure of sites following the decision to exit from non-core operations.  e reversal of previously recognised provisions of  0.3m (2007:  0.8m) has
arisen as a result of lower than expected repairs and dilapidations costs than those previously provided for.
In the prior year a loss of  0.3m was incurred on the disposal of 12 units for consideration of  4.3m. Other costs of  1.5m were incurred in relation to
these disposals. Of the 12 units disposed, payments totalling  2.6m were made to landlords in relation to the surrender of three leases. 
On 16 April 2008 the Group agreed to sell 26 units within five subsidiary companies to Cavendish Bars Limited for a consideration of  1 each.
Completion of three of the companies took place on the same day. Completion of the sale of two of the Disposal Companies (which own ten of the
26 units) is conditional upon Luminar receiving landlord consent to the transfer of certain units, which do not form part of the disposal, out of the
Disposal Companies.  is transaction has generated a loss of  11.1m in the year, comprising a cash cost of  4.8m, impairments to assets and goodwill
of  7.9m, estimated transaction costs of  2.5m, and a release of provisions for onerous leases and finance leases, totalling  4.1m.
As part of the deal, the Group also agreed to enter into indemnities capped at  4.2m in favour of Cavendish Bars Limited in relation to guarantee
liabilities given on leases for units sold previously. At the year end  3.5m of this indemnity was provided for, being the amount relating to property
costs.
During the prior year a tax credit of  20.0m was recognised on exceptional items relating to discontinued operations.  is arose due to the release of
the entire deferred tax liability carried in respect of the units disposed of during the year, principally the liability relating to the units sold as part of
the Entertainment Division disposal.

 e majority of the Group's goodwill, excluding the  8.1m of goodwill which arose on the acquisition of 13 units from  e Nightclub Company
(TNC ) in 2005 and the current year additions of  0.6m, arose from the acquisition of units that now predominantly form part of the dancing
segment and which were acquired from either Allied Leisure plc on 6 December 1999 or from Northern Leisure Plc on 11 July 2000.
Goodwill by segment
A Cash Generating Unit (CGU ) is deemed to be an individual operating unit, as each unit generates profits and cash flows that are largely
independent from other units. Where multiple CGUs are acquired as part of a single business combination, the goodwill arising from the business
combination is attributed to individual CGUs, but is grouped together at a segment level, being the lowest level that management monitors goodwill.
Accordingly, CGUs have been grouped together at a segmental level for the purpose of the annual impairment review of goodwill.
At the year end,  170.2m (2007:  172.5m) of goodwill was attributed to the dancing segment, and  2.4m (2007:  2.4m) to the non-core segment.
Impairment of goodwill
In assessing whether a write-down of goodwill is required to the carrying value of the related asset, the carrying value of the CGU or group of CGUs,
is compared with its recoverable amount.  e recoverable amount for each CGU and collectively for groups of CGUs that make up the segments of
the Group's business, has been measured based on value in use (VIU ), with the exception of those units that were held for sale at the balance sheet
date, where the recoverable amount for these units has been based on the lower of cost and fair value less costs to sell. 
Luminar Group Holdings plc www.luminar.co.uk 74

14756LUMINAR:Layout 1  11/6/08  12:12  Page 74 10 gOODWIll (continued)
For the purposes of the annual impairment review, the recoverable amount for each of the Group's segments has been estimated on the following basis:
  Dancing: VIU;
  Non-core: VIU, or fair value less costs of sale for those CGUs held for sale at the balance sheet date.
 e Group estimates the VIU of its CGUs using a discounted cash flow model (DCF), which adjusts the cash flows for risks associated with the assets,
and are discounted using a pre-tax rate of 10.6% (2007: 11.0%).  e discount rate used is consistent across both segments.
 e VIU calculations have not included the benefits arising from any future asset enhancement expenditure, as this is not permitted by IAS 36.  e
VIU calculations therefore exclude the significant benefits anticipated from future refurbishments, together with the related capital expenditure,
resulting from the re-branding programme.  e growth rates included within the assumptions supporting the VIU calculations do not therefore
represent the Group's anticipated total forecast growth.
Fair value less costs to sell has been based on external o ers received for CGUs held for sale, or valuations from internal and external experts if no
o ers have been received to date.
Management have performed the annual impairment review of goodwill as required by IAS 36. During the year  2.9m of goodwill within the dancing
segment has been impaired in relation to units held for sale. No impairment was required in either the remaining dancing segment or the non-core
segment based on the value in use calculation, reflecting the strong performance of the dancing segment and the five former entertainment units. 
Goodwill allocated to the dancing segment
Only the goodwill allocated to the dancing segment is significant in comparison to the total carrying value of the Group's goodwill.  e key
assumptions required for the VIU calculation for the Dancing Division are sales and EBITDA growth.
 e Group has used formally approved budgets for the first year of its VIU calculation.  e VIU for years two to five has been based on forecast sales
and EBITDA growth/decline. Declining sales and EBITDA arises as a result of the exclusion of future refurbishment expenditure from the VIU
calculation, rather than using formally approved budgets. A terminal value assuming nil growth due to no refurbishment expenditure being included
in the VIU calculation has been applied to cash flows after year five.
Management believe that no reasonably possible change in the assumptions used in the VIU calculation would cause the carrying value of the
dancing segment goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.
Goodwill additions 
During the year the Group acquired two units for a total consideration of  2.7m.  e fair value of the net assets acquired was  2.1m, resulting in
goodwill of  0.6m.

Included within trade receivables at the year end was a balance of  0.4m (2007:  0.2m) with  e 3D Entertainment Group Limited relating to
recharges for the Group's services.
Unprovided trade receivables are not considered impaired due to significant cash collection of these receivables post-year end, and an agreed
payment profile for the older debtors. Trade receivables are spread over a number of counter-parties and as such credit risk is perceived to be low.
At 28 February 2008 other debtors contained a balance of  0.9m relating to a legal case and  0.6m relating to unit closure costs, which were in the
process of being reclaimed at the year end. In both cases payment has been received post-year end.  e remaining balance related to  0.2m (2007:
 1.1m and  0.2m working capital finalisation payment) of capital accruals to be recharged to  e 3D Entertainment Group Limited,  0.3m (2007:

FINANcIAl RIsK MANAgEMENT
Financial Risk Factors
 e Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (predominately cash flow interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.  e
Group's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse e ects on the
Group's financial performance.  e Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
a) Market risk
i) Currency risk
 e Group operates predominately within the UK and substantially all transactions are denominated in sterling; therefore, the Group does not su er
from a significant concentration of currency risk.
ii) price risk
 e Group is not exposed to equity security price risk or commodity price risk.
In addition to the financial instruments described in the measurement basis sections above, the Group also has the following financial instruments for
which additional disclosures are included in the notes to the financial statements:
cash and cash equivalents;
trade and other receivables (loan note);
finance lease obligations;
provisions; and
accruals.
Due to the predominately cash-based nature of the Group's operations, the only financial instruments that materially expose the Group to any of the
financial risks detailed in the notes below are debt financing and related interest rate swaps, and the disclosures that follow relate principally to these items.
 e Group uses derivative financial instruments in order to reduce its exposure to financial risk.  e use of such financial instruments constitutes an
integral part of the Group's funding strategy.  e Group manages its derivative financial instrument credit risk by only undertaking transactions with
relationship banks, with good credit ratings. Such transactions are governed by Board policies and procedures. 
iii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, the Group's income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market
interest rates. 
 e Group's interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. 
 e Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. Such interest rate swaps have the economic e ect of
converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates. Generally, the Group raises long-term borrowings at floating rates and swaps them into fixed
rates that are lower than those available if the Group borrowed at fixed rates directly. Under the interest rate swaps, the Group agrees with other parties
to exchange, at specified intervals (primarily quarterly), the di erence between fixed contract rates and floating rate interest amounts calculated by
reference to the agreed notional amounts.
During the year ended 28 February 2008, if interest rates on UK denominated borrowings had been 0.5% higher with all other variables held constant,
pre-tax profit for the year would have been  0.5m lower based on an unhedged position, as a result of a higher interest expense on floating rate
borrowings. Taking the hedges into account, pre-tax profit for the year would have been  0.3m lower.  is will have a consequential e ect on equity,
excluding any change in the fair value of the derivatives as a result of the interest rate change.
b) Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and
financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to receivables principally recognised on sales of property assets and on income received from sub-lets.
 e Group does not have a significant concentration of credit risk, and the majority of the Group's revenues are cash-based.
A vendor loan note of  19.3m (plus accrued interest of  1.8m) with  e 3D Entertainment Group Limited is receivable on the earliest of a subsequent
sale of the business, refinancing or 2013. At the year end, the recoverability of the loan was not perceived to be a high credit risk.
 e Group's funding is provided by banks with an AAA credit rating.  e cash balance of  7.1m at the year end was spread across four di erent banks
with no single deposit greater than  3.3m in any one bank.

c) Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining su cient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate
amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions. 
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group's liquidity reserve on the basis of expected cash flow. In addition, the Group's liquidity
management policy involves monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios against internal and external regulatory requirements, and maintaining debt
financing plans. Liquidity risk is managed through an assessment of short, medium and long-term cash flow forecasts to ensure the adequacy of
committed debt facilities. 
 e table below analyses the Group's financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the

v) Finance lease liabilities at fixed rate: given the length of time to maturity of these liabilities and the length of time since inception of the lease, the
fair value of these liabilities at the balance sheet date is lower than current book value.
vi)  e fair value of cash flow hedges has been determined with reference to market rates at the balance sheet date. At 28 February 2008 the book
value of these swaps equated to their fair value as these derivatives were stated at their fair value under IAS 39.

d) Derivative financial instruments
 e Group has three cash flow hedges in place at the year end, hedging the majority of the interest rate risk of the Group's borrowings.  e notional
principal amounts of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 28 February 2008 was  90.0m for two fixed rate swaps and  50.0m for a cap and
collar swap.  e fixed interest rates on the swaps were 5.54% (on the  40.0m swap) and 5.56% (on the  50.0m swap).  e cap and floor was not
triggered at the year end, due to the LIBOR rate being below the cap rate of 6.25% and above the floor rate of 4.48%. 
 ese swaps were fair valued at  2.7m liability at the year end, determined using discounted cash flow valuation techniques.  e Group uses a variety
of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.

ONEROus lEAsEs
Provisions for onerous leases represent onerous commitments on operating leases for properties currently vacant or for closed units, where
assignment of the lease or sub-let of the property is unlikely in the short-term. 
Provision is made for rent and related property costs for the period management estimate the property would not be sub-let, or until assignment of
the lease is probable, and ranges up to three years.
Where the property is deemed likely to be assigned, provision is made for the best estimate of the reverse lease premium payable on the assignment,
if this represents the least cost to exit from the commitment.
 e amount and timing of the cash outflows relating to onerous leases are subject to variations. In estimating the amount and timing of cash flows,
management utilise the skills and experience of both internal and external property specialists, and are satisfied that the resulting estimated provision
is appropriate.
During the year  3.3m of onerous lease provisions relating to units to be disposed of as a package were released unutilised. A provision of  0.4m was
retained to cover the period from the balance sheet date to the expected completion date.
PuBlIc lIABIlITY INsuRANcE
Provision for public liability insurance is made for the estimated exposure of the Group to claims, based upon experience of historical claims.  is
provision is expected to be utilised within two years.
OTHER PROVIsIONs
Other provisions represent the remaining cash payment of  4.7m to be made to Cavendish Bars Limited for disposal of the five subsidiary companies,
 3.5m for the indemnity provision given to Cavendish Bars Limited in relation to guarantee liabilities given on leases for units sold previously and
 0.1m of costs associated with various legal proceedings of a type typical to the Group's business, and are expected to be utilised within one to
two years.

Deferred taxation provided for in the financial statements at the year end represents provision at 28% (2007: 30%) on the temporary di erences
between the accounting net book amount of property, plant and equipment, and the tax base of those assets.  is change in rate applied reflects
the change in the standard rate of UK corporation tax that the deferred tax is expected to reverse at.
 e deferred tax liability has been calculated using estimates based on the current manner of recovery of the assets' value on property, plant and
equipment not eligible for capital allowances, i.e. recovery through continued use in the business unless the asset is held for sale.  is method
assumes no tax relief will be available; therefore no tax base is available for inclusion within the calculation of the deferred tax liability, unless the
assets' value is recovered through sale rather than continued use.
 e key assumptions in the calculation of deferred tax are set out below:
  Capital expenditure.  e percentage of the Group's capital expenditure that would qualify for tax relief, incurred by each unit, has been estimated
based on prior periods historical experience of the split between qualifying and non-qualifying expenditure.
  Impairments.  e impairments to property, plant and equipment have been apportioned between assets that qualify for tax relief and those 
that do not.
  Depreciation.  e rate of depreciation for assets that do not qualify for the initial recognition exemption has been estimated based on actual
data for the most recent accounting periods.
A review of the deferred tax liability will be performed at each balance sheet date and adjustments made in the event of a change in any key
assumptions.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has estimated unused capital gains tax losses of  29.0m available for o set against future taxable profits from
capital disposals. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses due to the unpredictability of future profit streams available to
o set these losses.

Scheme of Arrangement
On 19 October 2007 Luminar Group holdings plc replaced Luminar plc as the listed holding company for the Group and undertook a Scheme of
Arrangement in order to create su cient distributable reserves to facilitate its plans for returning cash to shareholders. Following this change,
distributable reserves of over  200.0m were created in the Company accounts of Luminar Group holdings plc, after the return of capital to
shareholders as detailed below.
On 19 October 2007 the Company had authorised share capital of 95,000,000 ordinary shares of  6.00 each, 75,000,000 B shares of 60.2 pence each,
5,000,010,000 A ordinary shares of 1 pence each, and 1 redeemable preference share of  50,000.
On 19 October 2007 633,030,438 A ordinary shares were allotted and the entire class of share was cancelled.
Under the terms of the Scheme, shareholders holding existing ordinary shares in Luminar plc at the time of the restructure, received ten new ordinary
shares (equating to 61,578,804 shares) in Luminar Group holdings plc for every 11 existing ordinary shares (equating to 67,736,685 shares) in Luminar
plc, and one B share (equating to 67,736,685 shares) in Luminar Group holdings plc for every one existing ordinary share in Luminar plc.
Scheme shareholders were given the choice to receive their return from the B shares by way of either a B share dividend, or a B share redemption.
47,355,659 B shares were redeemed for  28.5m, and the shares were subsequently cancelled. A dividend amounting to  12.3m was paid in relation to
the remaining 20,381,026 B shares.  ese shares are classified as Deferred Shares, which have negligible value and are not listed.  ese shares will be
redeemed following the circulation of this Annual Report.  e Scheme of Arrangement delivered a total return to shareholders of  40.8m.
On 23 October 2007 the preference share was redeemed at par. On the same day the nominal value of the ordinary shares were reduced from  6.00 a
share to  2.00 a share.
During the year, the Company has bought back 2,755,422 ordinary shares under its share buy-back programme.
During the year 56,571 ordinary shares were issued for a cash consideration of  0.2m to satisfy exercises of options under the Group's 1996 Executive
Share Option Scheme. A further 17,588 ordinary shares were issued for a cash consideration of  0.1m to satisfy exercises of options under the Group's
Save-As-You-Earn Option Scheme.

 e Group has followed the transitional arrangements within IFRS 2, share-based payment, and has adopted the exemption from full retrospective
application of all share-based payment awards, and has only applied the measurement requirements of IFRS 2 to awards made after 7 November 2002.
however the following disclosures include all share-based payment awards, therefore including those equity-settled awards granted prior to
7 November 2002.
 e Group operates the following share-based payment plans:
a) Deferred Bonus Plan
 is was approved by shareholders in 2004 and was operated in 2004 and 2005. Under the terms of the Plan, 50% of the bonus entitlement of Executive
Directors is deferred for three years into a deferred bonus award which is notionally invested in the Company's shares. Any dividends accruing on the
notional shares are accrued to the benefit of the Executive Directors. Matching shares can be awarded (up to two matching shares for each notional
share), based on the shareholder return of the Group relative to the FTSE 250 Index over the relevant three year period. 
 e settlement of benefits accruing under the Deferred Bonus Plan is in equity or cash, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. Accounting
for the Deferred Bonus Plan has assumed that all awards will be equity-settled. Awards will not vest in full unless the Executive Director remains in the
service of the Group, other than in exceptional circumstances. In the event of a change of control, deferred bonus awards and matching award vest early
(matching awards will only vest to the extent that the performance conditions have been met and may be subject to time pro-rating). 
b) 1996 Executive Share Option Scheme & 1999 Company Share Option Plan
Options granted under the 1996 Scheme (which are unapproved options) and the 1999 Plan (which are hM Revenue & Customs approved options) are
exercisable between three and ten years from the grant date, subject to the employee remaining in the service of the Group. Options were originally
granted subject to performance conditions requiring Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth over a three year period. Outstanding options were rolled over into
equivalent options over shares in Luminar Group holdings plc in connection with the Reorganisation in 2007. Following the technical change of control
of Luminar plc in connection with the Reorganisation, the Rules of the 1996 Scheme prescribed that unapproved options became immediately
exercisable, with performance conditions falling away, resulting in an exceptional charge of  0.7m during the year.  erefore, the exercise of the rolled
over unapproved options is not subject to any performance conditions. Similarly, rolled over approved options are not subject to performance
conditions, as prescribed by the rules of the 1999 Plan.  is is a common provision in rules of this vintage. 
c) Northern Leisure 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme (Rolled over  options)
Options granted under the Northern Leisure scheme were granted to holders of existing super options of Northern Leisure Plc, who elected to release
those in exchange for an equivalent option over Luminar plc shares, in connection with the acquisition of Northern Leisure Plc. In turn, these new
options were rolled over into options over shares in Luminar Group holdings plc in connection with the Reorganisation.
Outstanding options are already exercisable and will remain until ten years from the grant date of the original super options. All options were granted
prior to 7 November 2002 and accordingly are excluded from the scope of IFRS 2.
d) SAYE Scheme
All outstanding options under the SAYE Scheme were either exercised or lapsed during the year.
e) Warrant Scheme
On 22 February 1999 the shareholders approved the establishment of a discretionary Trust to hold warrants as part of incentive arrangements under
which they are subsequently allocated to employees. Each warrant carried the right to subscribe for one ordinary share at the price of  6.67  per share.
Performance criteria attached to the warrant scheme were met in full in February 2002.  e warrants may be exercised in the period of 28 days following
the publication of the Annual Report of each financial year up to the year ending on or around 1 March 2009. More details on the 1999 warrant scheme
trust can be found within the Remuneration Report on page 43.
f) Restricted share award
In July 2006, the Remuneration Committee made a one-o  retention award of 47,900 restricted shares to Nick Beighton, the Finance Director. Fifty per
cent of the shares vested in July 2007 (together with 400 shares acquired under the dividend equivalent provisions in Nick Beighton's award agreement)
and the remaining 50% vest in July 2008, subject to his continued employment with Luminar. Awards will vest early in the event of an external change of
control.
g) One-o  Phantom Long-term Incentive Award to the Chairman
In December 2006, the Remuneration Committee made a one-o  cash award over 73,314 notional shares, to Alan Jackson, the Group Chairman (the
Phantom Award ). Vesting of the Phantom Award is based on the Group's TSR performance over a three year vesting period. Forty per cent of the
Phantom Award will vest if Luminar's TSR is equal to the TSR of the median company.  e Phantom Award will vest in full if Luminar's TSR is equal to or
above the TSR of the upper quartile company. Straight-line vesting will occur between these points. In the event of a change of control or if Mr Jackson
leaves in certain compassionate circumstances, performance will be measured over the shorter period and awards will be scaled back on a time 
pro-rata basis.

h) Luminar Group Holdings 2007 Performance Share Plan
 is was approved by shareholders at the 2007 AGM. Under the terms of the Performance Share Plan, Executives can be awarded conditional awards
of free shares which are capable of vesting subject to performance and continued service over a three year period.  e first grants under the plan
were made in November 2007 and will vest on 1 August 2010. 
 e 2007 awards granted to Executive Directors and other senior Executives are subject to performance conditions relating to Total Shareholder Return
(50% of the award) and strategic milestone targets (50% of the award). See page 40 of the Remuneration Report for further details of these targets.  e
awards granted to other employees are subject to a sliding scale of operating profit targets based on Group and/or unit/area performance.
In the event of a change of control, awards will vest early subject to performance and time pro-rating (although the Remuneration Committee has
the discretion not to apply time pro-rating if it considers it inappropriate to do so).

28 REsERVEs
 e reconciliation of movements in reserves is presented, as a Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders' Equity, on page 54. Within this
reconciliation the Group has presented the following reserves as follows:
 e capital reserve which arose on the formation of Luminar plc when the principles of merger accounting were followed;
 e capital redemption reserve which arose as a result of the share buy-backs carried out during the year and the prior year. During the year as a
result of the restructure, an additional amount of  28.5m has been credited to this reserve, which represents the redemption of the  B' shares (see
note 26); 
 e merger reserve which arose on the acquisition of Northern Leisure plc when the principles of acquisition accounting were followed; and
 e equity reserve which arose on recognition of share-based payment expenses following the requirements of IFRS 2, share-based payment. 
 e capital, capital redemption, merger and equity reserves are all non-distributable reserves.
As a result of the restructure that took place during the year, the capital reserve and merger reserve are now distributable and have therefore been
transferred into the retained earnings reserve.
Of the closing retained earnings reserve of  142.7m, ( 2.0m) (2007:  nil) related to treasury share adjustments and ( 2.7m) (2007:  nil) related to the
change in fair value of the cash flow hedges. Of the  2.7m fair value liability, a  0.4m asset relates to amounts recycled through the income statement,
and a  3.1m loss reflects the change in the mark-to-market value.

 e Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for
shareholders and benefits for the other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.  is ratio is calculated as net debt divided by
total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including finance leases less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as
shareholders' equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
 e net debt position is shown on page 53.  e movement in net debt in the year is analysed as follows:
1 March Non-cash 28 February
2007 Cash flow flows 2008
 m  m  m  m
Cash and cash equivalents* 14.7 (7.6)   7.1
Loans due in more than 1 year (73.3) (71.2) (0.5) (145.0)
(58.6) (78.8) (0.5) (137.9)
Finance leases* (8.8)   0.9 (7.9)
NET DEBT (67.4) (78.8) 0.4 (145.8)
* Includes cash and cash equivalents and finance leases relating to units held for sale
With total capital of  307.9m, the gearing ratio was 47.4% at 28 February 2008 (1 March 2007: 17.8%).  e increase was a result of the restructure (the
Scheme of Arrangement) of the Group during the year.

 e Group leases various properties relating to trading units or o ce and warehouse accommodation; these leases have various terms, escalation
values and renewal rights.
At the year end, the operating leases which had been sold to  e 3D Entertainment Group Limited had not all been assigned yet due to the expected
time of two years needed to liaise with the landlords.  erefore, the commitment above includes those leases yet to be assigned, for which there is an
equal and o setting expected rental income to be received from  e 3D Entertainment Group Limited. Consequently, the commitment for the leases
sold to  e 3D Entertainment Group Limited will not a ect the net operating lease rental charge shown in the consolidated income statement.
32 PENsIONs 
 e Group operates defined contribution schemes for the benefit of Directors and employees.  e schemes are administered by trustees and the
assets are held in a fund independent from those of the Group.  e cost to the Group of pension contributions is included in note 4.
33 cONTINgENT AssETs AND cONTINgENT lIABIlITIEs
On 16 April 2008 the Group agreed to sell five individual companies to Cavendish Bars Limited. As at 14 May 2008 the sale of three of the five
companies had been completed, and the remaining two had exchanged.  e disposal companies are responsible for all of the leases of the units
being sold and are contingently liable as guarantors for a number of other non-core units, including all of the leases relating to units that were sold by
the Group to Candu Entertainment Group Limited in June 2005. As part of the transaction, the Group has entered into indemnities capped at  4.2m
in favour of Cavendish Bars Limited in relation to the guarantees. At the year end  3.5m of this indemnity has been provided for, being the indemnity
for property costs which the Group considers are likely to be called upon by Cavendish Bars Limited.
 e Group is currently pursuing a case against hM Revenue & Customs in respect of VAT of  5.1m (2007:  5.1m) that we believe has been overpaid.
34 cAPITAl cOMMITMENTs
 e Group had capital commitments relating to property, plant and equipment of  16.0m at 28 February 2008 (2007:  11.8m).
35 RElATED PARTY TRANsAcTIONs
During the year, IT support services were provided at normal market prices by Choir IT Limited, which is an associate of the Group, amounting to
 0.3m (2007:  0.7m), none of which was outstanding at 28 February 2008 (2007:  nil). Of the amount incurred,  0.2m (2007:  0.5m) was capitalised
within other intangible assets during the year. 
 e Group incurred costs of  13.3m (2007:  20.6m) from Eminence Leisure Limited, which is an associate of the Group, in respect of entertainment
acts and bookings, of which  0.3m (2007:  0.3m) remained outstanding at the year end. No income (2007:  0.1m) was received from Eminence
Leisure Limited during the year. At the prior year end none of the income remained outstanding.
In the prior year, the Group sold certain trade and assets of its units to  e 3D Entertainment Group Limited.
Post-completion on 19 January 2007 a transitional services agreement was in place between the Group and  e 3D Entertainment Group Limited (an
associate of the Group) for the provision of certain services.  1.4m (2007:  0.2m) of income has been credited within administrative expenses in
relation to the provision of these services. At the year end,  21.1m (2007:  19.5m) was owed to the Group in relation to the loan note and accrued
interest,  nil (2007:  0.2m) was owed in respect of finalisation of the working capital payment,  0.2m (2007:  1.1m) was owed in respect of capital
amounts and other recharges and  0.4m (2007:  0.2m) was owed in respect of the transitional services agreement.
During the year, the Group recognised income of  0.1m (2007:  nil) from Lucien Barriere for costs incurred relating to the Waterimage Limted joint
venture (see note 14). Of the amount recognised,  0.1m (2007:  nil) remained outstanding at the year end.

PRINcIPAl AccOuNTINg POlIcIEs FOR THE 
cOMPANY FINANcIAl sTATEMENTs
BAsIs OF PREPARATION
 ese financial statements present financial information for Luminar
Group holdings plc as a separate entity, and are prepared in accordance
with the historical cost convention, the Companies Act 1985 and UK
Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
 e Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by
the European Union, are separately presented.  e principal accounting
policies adopted in these Company financial statements are set out below
and, unless otherwise indicated, have been consistently applied for the
periods presented.
In accordance with FRS 18, Accounting principles, the Directors have
reviewed the accounting policies of the Company as set out below and
consider them to be appropriate.
cAsH FlOW sTATEMENT AND RElATED PARTY
TRANsAcTIONs
 e Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a
cash flow statement under FRS 1 (Revised 1996), Cash flow statements.  e
Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8, related party disclosures,
from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are part of the
Luminar Group holdings plc group.
IMPAcT OF NEW AccOuNTINg sTANDARDs
 e Company has applied all applicable accounting standards in issue,
which are required to be adopted for this period end.
Impact of accounting standards issued but not adopted
 e Company has considered all new accounting standards which have
been published at 28 February 2008 but are not yet e ective. 
Amendment to FRS 20, share-based payment, e ective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.  is standard deals with
vesting conditions and cancellations. It clarifies that vesting conditions are
service conditions and performance conditions only, and that all
cancellations, whether by the entity or by other parties, should receive 
the same accounting treatment. Management do not expect this 
standard will impact on the Company's accounting for the existing share
option schemes.
TuRNOVER
Turnover is the total amount receivable by the Company for management
and other services provided to other group companies, excluding VAT, and
is recognised on performance of these services.
INVEsTMENTs
Investments in subsidiary undertakings and associates are stated at cost
less amounts written o  for impairment. Amounts advanced to subsidiary
undertakings with no intention of being repaid in the foreseeable future
are classified as investments.
BAsIs OF IMPAIRMENT
On an annual basis the Company performs a review of its investments to
determine whether there have been any impairment trigger events. If such
a trigger event is considered to be a permanent diminution in value, rather
than a temporary diminution in value, then the recoverable amount of the
asset, or where appropriate group of assets, in cash generating units that
comprise the investment, is estimated and compared to the carrying
amount of the asset.  e recoverable amount is the higher of the value in
use to the Company of the asset and the net realisable value from disposal
of the asset. Value in use is estimated by calculating the net present value
of the estimated future cash flows relating to the cash generating units
that comprise the investment after applying a discount factor. Net
realisable value is estimated by applying the knowledge and experience of
management, together with external market indicators. If the recoverable
amount is below the carrying value of the asset then the carrying value of
the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount, and the resulting charge is
taken to the profit and loss account.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT cOsTs
Payments made to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are
charged as an expense when they fall due.  e Company has no other
retirement benefit schemes.
FINANcIAl INsTRuMENTs
 e Company has applied FRS 25, Financial instruments: Disclosure and
presentation, and FRS 26, Financial instruments: Measurement. 
Financial assets and liabilities   measurement basis
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the date on which the
Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument
giving rise to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are initially
recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Any impairment of a
financial asset is charged to the profit and loss account when incurred.
Financial assets are derecognised when the Company's rights to cash
inflows from the asset expire; financial liabilities are derecognised when the
contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
Financial assets are classified according to the purpose for which the asset
was acquired.  e Company's financial assets are classified as:
  debtors    these are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.  ey
arise when the Company provides goods or services directly to a
debtor, or advances money, with no intention of trading the loan or
receivable. Subsequent to initial recognition loans and receivables are
included in the balance sheet at amortised cost using the e ective
interest method less any amounts written o  to reflect impairment,
with changes in carrying amount recognised in the profit and
loss account.

14756 09/06/2008 Proof8
14756LUMINAR:Layout 1  11/6/08  12:12  Page 100  e Company's financial liabilities are classified as either Creditors: amounts
falling due within one year  or Creditors: amounts falling due after more
than one year .  ese are non-derivative financial liabilities with fixed or
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.  ey arise
when the Company receives goods or services directly from a creditor or
supplier, or borrows money, with no intention of trading the liability.  is
category includes:
  trade creditors   these are typically non-interest bearing and following
initial recognition are included in the balance sheet at amortised cost.
  bank loans   these are initially recorded at fair value based on proceeds
received, net of issue costs. Finance charges are accounted for on an
accruals basis and charged to the profit and loss account using the
e ective interest rate method.
Financial instruments   other disclosures
 e Company's debt financing and other activities expose it to a variety of
financial risks that include the e ects of changes in the following:
Interest rate risk
 e Company has intercompany balances with some of its subsidiaries.
Some of the outstanding balances are interest bearing loans, which bear
interest at 0.75% above LIBOR.
Currency risk
 e Company operates within the UK and substantially all transactions are
denominated in sterling; therefore, the Company does not su er from a
significant concentration of currency risk.
Credit risk
 e Company does not have a significant concentration of credit risk. All
receivables arise from transactions in the ordinary course of business with
trading subsidiaries.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is managed through an assessment of short, medium and 
long-term cash flow forecasts to ensure the adequacy of committed 
debt facilities. 
Price risk
 e Company is not exposed to equity security price risk or commodity
price risk.
sHARE-BAsED PAYMENTs
 e Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20, share-based payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all
grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as
of 1 January 2005.
Where equity instruments are granted to employees of subsidiary
undertakings for the services provided by the employees to those companies,
the fair value at the grant date of the equity instrument represents an
additional investment in the subsidiary undertaking by the parent.
 e Company issues some equity instruments where the counter-party has
a choice of either cash or equity settlement and some equity instruments,
where the settlement can only be in equity.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of
grant.  e fair value determined at grant date is expensed on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period, based on the Company's estimate of the shares
that will actually vest. Fair value is measured by means of a binomial model.
A liability equal to the portion of the goods or services received is
recognised at the current fair value at each balance sheet date for cash
settled share-based payments.
IssuE cOsTs
Costs directly related with establishing loan finance are o set against the
value of the loan. Such costs are amortised over the period of the loan with
the resulting charge being recognised in interest expense.
TAXATION
UK corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or
recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing di erences that have
originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or
events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to
pay less tax in the future, have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing
di erences are di erences between the Company's taxable profits and its
results as stated in the financial statements, that arise from the inclusion of
gains and losses in tax assessments in periods di erent from those in which
they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised
only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more
likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the
future reversal of the underlying timing di erences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates and laws that are expected
to apply in the periods in which the timing di erences are expected to
reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
recognised have not been discounted.
EquITY DIVIDENDs
Final dividends are recognised in the Company's financial statements in the
period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders. Interim
dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.
DIVIDEND INcOME
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders'
rights to receive payment have been established.

Incorporation
 e Company was incorporated on 8 May 2007 with authorised share capital of 100 ordinary shares of  1.00 each and one redeemable preference
share of  50,000.
On 31 August 2007 the authorised share capital was increased to  665,200,100 by the creation of 95,000,000 ordinary shares of  6.00 each, 75,000,000 
B shares of 60.2 pence each and 5,000,000,000 A ordinary shares of 1 pence each.  e 100 ordinary shares of  1.00 each were also reclassified into
10,000 ordinary shares of 1 pence each.
Scheme of Arrangement
On 19 October 2007 Luminar Group holdings plc replaced Luminar plc as the listed holding company for the Group and undertook a Scheme of
Arrangement in order to create su cient distributable reserves to facilitate its plans for returning cash to shareholders. Following this change,
distributable reserves of over  200.0m were created in the Company after the return of capital to shareholders as detailed below.
On 19 October 2007 633,030,438 A ordinary shares were allotted and the entire class of share was cancelled.
Under the terms of the Scheme, shareholders holding existing ordinary shares in Luminar plc at the time of the restructure received ten new ordinary
shares (equating to 61,578,804 shares) in Luminar Group holdings plc for every 11 existing ordinary shares (equating to 67,736,685 shares) in Luminar
plc, and one B share (equating to 67,736,685 shares) in Luminar Group holdings plc for every one existing ordinary share in Luminar plc.
Scheme shareholders were given the choice to receive their return from the B shares by way of either a B share dividend or a B share redemption.
47,355,659 B shares were redeemed for  28.5m, and the shares were subsequently cancelled. A dividend amounting to  12.3m was paid in relation to
the remaining 20,381,026 B shares.  ese shares are classified as Deferred Shares, which have negligible value and are not listed.  ese shares will be
redeemed following the circulation of this Annual Report.  e Scheme of Arrangement delivered a total return to shareholders of  40.8m.
On 23 October 2007 the preference share was redeemed at par. On the same day the nominal value of the ordinary shares were reduced from  6.00 a
share to  2.00 a share.
During the period, the Company has bought back 630,000 ordinary shares under its share buy-back programme.
During the period 150 ordinary shares were issued for a cash consideration of  620 to satisfy exercises of options under the Company's Save-As-You-

11 sHARE-BAsED PAYMENTs 
 e following share-based payment plans (with the exception of the performance share plan) were in existence in Luminar plc. Following the
Reorganisation, these plans are now in operation in Luminar Group holdings plc.
 e Company has followed the transitional arrangements within FRS 20, share-based payment, and has adopted the exemption from full
retrospective application of all share-based payment awards, and has only applied the measurement requirements of FRS 20 to awards made after
7 November 2002. however, the following disclosures include all share-based payment awards, therefore including those equity-settled awards
granted prior to 7 November 2002.
 e Company operates the following share-based payment plans:
a) Deferred Bonus Plan
 is was approved by Luminar plc shareholders in 2004 and was operated in 2004 and 2005. Under the terms of the Plan, 50% of the bonus entitlement
of Executive Directors is deferred for three years into a deferred bonus award which is notionally invested in the Company's shares. Any dividends
accruing on the notional shares are accrued to the benefit of the Executive Directors. Matching shares can be awarded (up to two matching shares for
each notional share), based on the shareholder return of the Company relative to the FTSE 250 Index over the relevant three year period. 
 e settlement of benefits accruing under the Deferred Bonus Plan is in equity or cash, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Accounting for the Deferred Bonus Plan has assumed that all awards will be equity-settled. Awards will not vest in full unless the Executive Director
remains in the service of the Company, other than in exceptional circumstances. In the event of a change of control, deferred bonus awards and
matching awards vest early (matching awards will only vest to the extent that the performance conditions have been met and may be subject to
time pro-rating). 
b) 1996 Executive Share Option Scheme & 1999 Company Share Option Plan
Options granted under the 1996 Scheme (which are unapproved options) and the 1999 Plan (which are hM Revenue & Customs approved options)
are exercisable between three and ten years from the grant date, subject to the employee remaining in the service of the Company. Options were
originally granted subject to performance conditions requiring Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth over a three year period. Outstanding options were
rolled over into equivalent options over shares in Luminar Group holdings plc in connection with the Reorganisation in 2007. Following the technical
change of control of Luminar plc in connection with the Reorganisation, the Rules of the 1996 Scheme prescribed that unapproved options became
immediately exercisable, with performance conditions falling away, resulting in an exceptional charge of  0.7m during the period.  erefore, the
exercise of the rolled over unapproved options is not subject to any performance conditions. Similarly, rolled over approved options are not subject
to performance conditions, as prescribed by the rules of the 1999 Plan.  is is a common provision in rules of this vintage. 
c) Northern Leisure 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme (Rolled over  options)
Options granted under the Northern Leisure scheme were granted to holders of existing super options of Northern Leisure Plc, who elected to
release those in exchange for an equivalent option over Luminar plc shares, in connection with the acquisition of Northern Leisure Plc. In turn, these
new options were rolled over into options over shares in Luminar Group holdings plc in connection with the Reorganisation.
Outstanding options are already exercisable and will remain until ten years from the grant date of the original super options. All options were granted
prior to 7 November 2002 and accordingly are excluded from the scope of FRS 20.
d) SAYE Scheme
All outstanding options under the SAYE Scheme were either exercised or lapsed during the period.
e) Warrant Scheme
On 22 February 1999 the Luminar plc shareholders approved the establishment of a discretionary Trust to hold warrants as part of incentive
arrangements under which they are subsequently allocated to employees. Each warrant carried the right to subscribe for one ordinary share at the
price of  6.67  per share. Performance criteria attached to the warrant scheme were met in full in February 2002.  e warrants may be exercised in
the period of 28 days following the publication of the Annual Report of each financial year up to the year ending on or around 1 March 2009. More
details on the 1999 warrant scheme trust can be found within the Remuneration Report on page 43.

f) Restricted share award
In July 2006, the Remuneration Committee made a one-o  retention award of 47,900 restricted shares to Nick Beighton, the Finance Director. Fifty
per cent of the shares vested in July 2007 (together with 400 shares acquired under the dividend equivalent provisions in Nick Beighton's award
agreement) and the remaining 50% vest in July 2008, subject to his continued employment with Luminar. Awards will vest early in the event of an
external change of control.
g) One-o  Phantom Long-term Incentive Award to the Chairman
In December 2006, the Remuneration Committee made a one-o  cash award over 73,314 notional shares, to Alan Jackson, the Group Chairman (the
Phantom Award ). Vesting of the Phantom Award is based on the Company's TSR performance over a three year vesting period. Forty per cent of
the Phantom Award will vest if Luminar's TSR is equal to the TSR of the median company.  e Phantom Award will vest in full if Luminar's TSR is
equal to or above the TSR of the upper quartile company. Straight-line vesting will occur between these points. In the event of a change of control or
if Mr Jackson leaves in certain compassionate circumstances, performance will be measured over the shorter period and awards will be scaled back
on a time pro-rata basis.
h) Luminar Group Holdings 2007 Performance Share Plan
 is was approved by shareholders at the 2007 AGM. Under the terms of the Performance Share Plan, Executives can be awarded conditional awards
of free shares which are capable of vesting subject to performance and continued service over a three year period.  e first grants under the plan
were made in November 2007 and will vest on 1 August 2010. 
 e 2007 awards granted to Executive Directors and other senior Executives are subject to performance conditions relating to Total Shareholder Return
(50% of the award) and strategic milestone targets (50% of the award). See page 40 of the Remuneration Report for further details of these targets.  e
awards granted to other employees are subject to a sliding scale of operating profit targets based on Group and/or unit/area performance.
In the event of a change of control, awards will vest early subject to performance and time pro-rating (although the Remuneration Committee has
the discretion not to apply time pro-rating if it considers it inappropriate to do so).

 e options granted during the period to replace the Luminar plc options have been granted as equivalent options.  erefore, their fair value has not
been recalculated.
 e fair value for options granted during the period has been determined using a binomial model.  e assumptions and inputs to the model for
options granted during the period were as follows:

 e expected volatility is estimated using the historical volatility of the Company's shares over a period equivalent to the expected life of the option.
 e Company recognised a total charge within administrative expenses of  0.1m and exceptional items of  0.7m, related to share-based payment
transactions, all of which were accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment arrangements with a corresponding credit direct to equity
reserves.  e cumulative credit to equity reserves in respect of share-based payments totalled  1.2m.

NOTEs
1. Members are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their
rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at the meeting.
A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the
Annual General Meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to
exercise the rights attached to a di erent share or shares held by that
shareholder. A proxy need not be a shareholder of the Company. A
proxy form which may be used to make such appointment and give
proxy instructions accompanies this notice. If you do not have a proxy
form and believe that you should have one, or if you require additional
forms, please contact Equiniti Limited, the Company's registrars, on
0871 384 2415 (calls to this number are charged at 8 pence per minute
from a BT landline; other telephony providers' costs may vary).
2. To be valid, the proxy form, together, if appropriate, with the power
of attorney or the authority (if any) under which it is signed, or a
notarially certified copy of such power or authority must be deposited
at the o ces of Equiniti Limited at Aspect house, Spencer Road,
Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6ZR by no later than 1.00 p.m. on
14 July 2008.
3.  e return of a completed proxy form or any CREST Proxy 
Instruction (as described below) will not prevent a shareholder
attending the Annual General Meeting and voting in person if he/she
wishes to do so.
4. Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated
under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information
rights (a Nominated Person ) may, under an agreement between
him/her and the shareholder by whom he/she was nominated, have a
right to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy
for the Annual General Meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such
proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may,
under any such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the
shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.
5.  e statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the
appointment of proxies above does not apply to Nominated Persons.
 e rights described in these paragraphs can only be exercised by
shareholders of the Company.
6. Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations
2001, the Company specifies that, to be entitled to attend and vote at
the Annual General Meeting (and for the purpose of the
determination by the Company of the votes they may cast),
shareholders must be registered in the Register of Members of the
Company at 6.00 p.m. on 14 July 2008 (or, in the event of any
adjournment, 6.00 p.m. on the date which is two days before the time
of the adjourned meeting). Changes to the Register of Members after
the relevant deadline shall be disregarded in determining the rights of
any person to attend and vote at the meeting.
7. As at 14 May 2008 (being the latest practicable date prior to the
publication of this Notice) the Company's issued share capital consists
of 60,948,969 ordinary shares, carrying one vote each.  erefore, the
total voting rights in the Company as at 14 May 2008 are 60,948,969.
8. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the
CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by using the
procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members
or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who
have appointed a service provider(s), should refer to their CREST
sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the
appropriate action on their behalf.
9. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the
CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a CREST
Proxy Instruction ) must be properly authenticated in accordance with
Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited's specifications, and must contain the
information required for such instruction, as described in the CREST
Manual.  e message, regardless of whether it constitutes the
appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given
to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be
transmitted so as to be received by the issuer's agent (ID 7RA01) by
1.00 p.m. on 14 July 2008. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be
taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the
message by the CREST Application host) from which the Company's
agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the
manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of
instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be
communicated to the appointee through other means.
10. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors, or
voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland
Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any
particular message. Normal system timings and limitations will,
therefore, apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It
is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the
CREST member is a CREST personal member, or sponsored member,
or has appointed a voting service provider, to procure that his CREST
sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be
necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the
CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST
members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting
system providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the
CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system
and timings.
11.  e Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the
circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated
Securities Regulations 2001.

12. Shareholders should note that it is possible that, pursuant to requests
made by shareholders of the Company under section 527 of the
Companies Act 2006, the Company may be required to publish on a
website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of
the Company's accounts (including the auditor's report and the

Meeting; or (ii) any circumstance connected with an auditor of the
Company ceasing to hold o ce since the previous meeting at which
annual accounts and reports were laid in accordance with section 437
of the Companies Act 2006.  e Company may not require the
shareholders requesting any such website publication to pay its
expenses in complying with sections 527 or 528 of the Companies Act
2006. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a
website under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006, it must
forward the statement to the Company's auditor not later than the
time when it makes the statement available on the website.  e
business which may be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting
includes any statement that the Company has been required under
section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website.
13. In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the
meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the meeting so that (i) if
a corporate shareholder has appointed the Chairman of the meeting
as its corporate representative with instructions to vote on a poll in
accordance with the directions of all of the other corporate
representatives for that shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll
those corporate representatives will give voting directions to the
Chairman and the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as
corporate representative in accordance with those directions; and (ii) if
more than one corporate representative for the same corporate
shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate shareholder has
not appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate
representative, a designated corporate representative will be
nominated from those corporate representatives who attend, who will
vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting
directions to that designated corporate representative. Corporate
shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of
Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on proxies and corporate
representatives (www.icsa.org.uk) for further details of this procedure.
 e guidance includes a sample form of representation letter if the
Chairman is being appointed as described in (i) above.
14. Addresses (including electronic addresses) in this document are
included strictly for the purposes specified and not for any other
purpose.

1. DIREcTORs' REPORT AND AccOuNTs (REsOluTION 1)
 e Directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to present to
the meeting the Directors' and Auditors' reports and the audited
accounts for the year ended 28 February 2008.
2. cONsIDER AND ADOPT THE REPORT ON REMuNERATION
(REsOluTION 2)
 e Directors are also required to present the Directors' Remuneration
Report for approval.  e Report is set out on pages 36 to 43.
3. DEclARATION OF DIVIDEND (REsOluTION 3)
 e proposed final dividend of 13.95 pence per ordinary share will be
paid on 25 July 2008 to shareholders who are on the Register of
Members as at the close of business on 20 June 2008.  is dividend is
in addition to the interim dividend of 5.37 pence per ordinary share
which was paid on 4 January 2008.  e shares will become ex-dividend
on 18 June 2008.
4. RE-ElEcTION OF DIREcTOR (REsOluTION 4) 
Article 87 of the Company's Articles of Association states that any
Director who has not been appointed or re-appointed at either of the
Company's last two Annual General Meetings should retire. Stephen
 omas is retiring and o ering himself for re-election under this
provision.
5. APPOINTMENT AND REMuNERATION OF AuDITORs
(REsOluTIONs 5 AND 6) 
 ese resolutions propose the re-appointment of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's auditors and permit
the Directors to fix their remuneration.
6. RENEWAl OF AuTHORITY TO AllOT sHAREs
(REsOluTIONs 7 AND 8) 
 e existing authorities given to the Directors at the last Annual General
Meeting to allot unissued share capital and to allot shares for cash in
limited circumstances expire on 16 July 2008. It is proposed that further
authorities be granted which shall expire on the date of the Annual
General Meeting of the Company in 2009. An ordinary resolution
(resolution 7) will be proposed to authorise the Directors to allot
unissued share capital up to an aggregate nominal amount of
 40,226,320 being 20,113,160 ordinary shares of 200p each representing
approximately 33% of the share capital currently in issue as at 14 May
2008, which is the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the
notice of meeting. A special resolution (resolution 8) will be proposed
authorising the Directors to allot shares in connection with a pre-
emptive issue to existing shareholders, but allowing the Directors to
modify statutory requirements for pre-emptive issues in order to deal
with legal, regulatory or practical problems that may arise.  e
resolution will also, if passed, authorise the Directors to issue shares for
cash on a non-pre-emptive basis of an aggregate nominal value of up to
 6,094,897 (being approximately 5% of the issued share capital currently
in issue as at 14 May 2008, which is the latest practicable date prior to
the publication of the notice of meeting).  ere are no present plans to
issue shares, except as required to satisfy the exercise of options or
warrants under the Company's employee share incentive schemes.
7. AuTHORITY TO PuRcHAsE OWN sHAREs (REsOluTION 9) 
 is special resolution would authorise the Company to acquire its
own shares subject to the constraints set out in the resolution.  e
resolution limits the number of shares that may be purchased to 10%
of the Company's issued share capital as at 14 May 2008, which is the
latest practicable date prior to the publication of the notice of
meeting.  e Directors would exercise this power only if satisfied that
it was in the interests of the shareholders as a whole to do so and that
it was likely to result in an increase in earnings per share. Any shares
purchased in accordance with this authority will subsequently be
cancelled.  e e ect of any cancellation would be to reduce the
number of shares in issue.
8. ADOPTION OF NEW ARTIclEs OF AssOcIATION
(REsOluTION 10)
It is proposed in resolution 10 to adopt new Articles of Association
(the New Articles ) in order to update the Company's current Articles
of Association (the Current Articles ) primarily to take account of
changes brought about by the Companies Act 2006.
 e principal changes introduced in the New Articles are summarised
in the Appendix on page 117 of this document. Other changes, which
are of a minor, technical or clarifying nature and also some more
minor changes which merely reflect changes made by the Companies
Act 2006 have not been noted in the Appendix.  e New Articles
showing all the changes to the Current Articles are available for
inspection, as noted on page 118 of this document.

APPENDIX TO THE NOTIcE OF ANNuAl gENERAl MEETIN g:
EXPlANATORY NOTEs OF PRINcIPAl cHANgEs TO THE cOMPANY's
ARTIclEs OF AssOcIATION
1. ARTIclEs WHIcH DuPlIcATE sTATuTORY PROVIsIONs
Provisions in the Current Articles which replicate provisions contained
in the Companies Act 2006 are in the main to be amended to bring
them into line with the Companies Act 2006. Certain examples of
such provisions include provisions as to the form of resolutions, the
variation of class rights, the requirement to keep accounting records
and provisions regarding the period of notice required to convene
general meetings.  e main changes made to reflect this approach are
detailed below.
2. FORM OF REsOluTION
 e Current Articles contain a provision that, where for any purpose
an ordinary resolution is required, a special or extraordinary resolution
is also e ective and that, where an extraordinary resolution is required,
a special resolution is also e ective.  is provision is being amended as
the concept of extraordinary resolutions has not been retained under
the Companies Act 2006. 
 e Current Articles enable members to act by written resolution.
Under the Companies Act 2006 public companies can no longer pass
written resolutions.  ese provisions have therefore been removed in
the New Articles.
3. VARIATION OF clAss RIgHTs
 e Current Articles contain provisions regarding the variation of class
rights.  e proceedings and specific quorum requirements for a
meeting convened to vary class rights are contained in the Companies
Act 2006.  e relevant provisions have therefore been amended in the
New Articles.
4. cHANgE OF NAME
Currently, a company can only change its name by special resolution.
Under the Companies Act 2006 a company will be able to change its
name by other means provided for by its Articles of Association. To
take advantage of this provision, the New Articles proposed to be
adopted pursuant to resolution 10 will enable the Directors to pass a
resolution to change the Company's name once the relevant
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 are in force.
5. cONVENINg EXTRAORDINARY AND ANNuAl gENERAl
MEETINgs
 e provisions in the Current Articles dealing with the convening of
general meetings and the length of notice required to convene general
meetings are being amended to conform to new provisions in the
Companies Act 2006. In particular, a general meeting to consider a
special resolution can be convened on 14 days' notice whereas
previously 21 days' notice was required.
6. REDEEMABlE sHAREs AND cONsOlIDATION, DIVIsION OR
suB-DIVIsION
At present, if a company wishes to issue redeemable shares it must
include in its Articles of Association the terms and manner of
redemption.  e Companies Act 2006 will enable the Directors to
determine such matters instead, provided that they are authorised to
do so by the Articles of Association.  e New Articles contain such an
authorisation that will take e ect once the relevant provisions of the
Companies Act 2006 are in force.  e Company has no plans to issue
redeemable shares, but if it did so the Directors would need
shareholder authority to issue new shares in the usual way. In
accordance with the Listing Rules, the New Articles permit the
Company to retain for its own benefit the net proceeds up to  5.00 of
selling fractional entitlements arising on a consolidation, division or
sub-division of its shares.
7. VOTEs OF MEMBERs
Under the Companies Act 2006 proxies are entitled to vote on a 
show of hands whereas under the Current Articles proxies are only
entitled to vote on a poll. Multiple proxies may be appointed provided
that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a
di erent share held by the shareholder.  e New Articles reflect all of
these new provisions.
8. AgE OF DIREcTORs ON APPOINTMENT
 e Current Articles contain a provision requiring a Director's age to
be disclosed if he has attained the age of 70 years or more in the
notice convening a meeting at which the Director is proposed to be
elected or re-elected. Such provision could now fall foul of the
Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 and so has been
removed from the New Articles.
9. cONFlIcTs OF INTEREsT
 e Companies Act 2006 sets out Directors' general duties which
largely codify the existing law but with some changes. Under the
Companies Act, from 1 October 2008 a Director must avoid a
situation where he has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that
conflicts, or possibly may conflict with the Company's interests.  e
requirement is very broad and could apply, for example, if a Director
becomes a director of another company or a trustee of another
organisation.  e Companies Act 2006 allows directors of public
companies to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts, where
appropriate, where the Articles of Association contain a provision to
this e ect.  e Companies Act 2006 also allows the Articles of
Association to contain other provisions for dealing with directors'
conflicts of interest to avoid a breach of duty.  e New Articles give
the Directors authority to approve such situations and to include
other provisions to allow conflicts of interest to be dealt with in a
similar way to the current position.
 ere are safeguards which will apply when Directors decide 
whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict. First, only
Directors who have no interest in the matter being considered will be
able to take the relevant decision, and secondly, in taking the decision
the Directors must act in a way they consider, in good faith, will be
most likely to promote the Company's success.  e Directors will be
able to impose limits or conditions when giving authorisation if they
think this is appropriate.
It is also proposed that the New Articles should contain provisions
relating to confidential information, attendance at Board meetings and
availability of Board papers to protect a Director being in breach of
duty if a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest arises.
 ese provisions will only apply where the position giving rise to the
potential conflict has previously been authorised by the Directors. It is
the Board's intention to report annually on the Company's procedures
for ensuring that the Board's powers of authorisation of conflicts are
operated e ectively and that the procedures have been followed.

10. ElEcTRONIc AND WEB cOMMuNIcATIONs
Provisions of the Companies Act 2006 which came into force in January
2007 enable companies to communicate with members by electronic
and/or website communications.  e New Articles continue to allow
communications to members in electronic form and, in addition, they
also permit the Company to take advantage of the new provisions
relating to website communications. Before the Company can
communicate with a member by means of website communication,
the relevant member must be asked individually by the Company to
agree that the Company may send or supply documents or
information to him by means of a website, and the Company must
either have received a positive response or have received no response
within the period of 28 days beginning with the date on which the
request was sent.  e Company will notify the member (either in
writing, or by other permitted means) when a relevant document or
information is placed on the website and a member can always request
a hard copy version of the document or information.
11. DIREcTORs' INDEMNITIEs AND lOANs TO FuND
EXPENDITuRE
 e Companies Act 2006 has in some areas widened the scope of the
powers of a company to indemnify directors and to fund expenditure
incurred in connection with certain actions against directors. In
particular, a company that is a trustee of an occupational pension
scheme can now indemnify a director against liability incurred in
connection with the company's activities as trustee of the scheme. In
addition, the existing exemption allowing a company to provide
money for the purpose of funding a director's defence in court
proceedings now expressly covers regulatory proceedings and applies
to associated companies. 
12. uPDATINg sTATuTORY AND REgulATORY REFERENcEs
 e opportunity is being taken to update references to legislation as
well as regulatory and other bodies.
